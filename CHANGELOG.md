## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.0] — 2026-05-24

One-shot schedules ("run once in 15 minutes / tomorrow at 9am"), plus
two community fixes.

### Added

- **One-shot / relative-delay schedules**
  ([#122](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/122),
  design by [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu)). Schedules can now
  run **once** at a future time or after a relative delay, alongside the
  existing recurring cron jobs:

  ```sh
  thclaws schedule add report --at "2026-05-24T15:30:00Z" --prompt "…"
  thclaws schedule add check  --in 15m                    --prompt "…"
  ```

  `--in` accepts `s`/`m`/`h`/`d` (and a bare integer as seconds);
  `--at` takes an RFC 3339 timestamp. Both are mutually exclusive with
  `--cron`. A one-shot fires once, then auto-disables. **Catch-up by
  design:** a fire time already in the past when the scheduler ticks
  (e.g. the daemon was down over the slot) runs immediately rather than
  being lost — the footgun of hand-writing a cron for a single minute,
  where a missed slot silently waits a year. `schedule list` shows
  `once@<time> (pending|fired)`; the new on-disk `runAt` field is
  optional, so existing `schedules.json` files stay compatible.

### Fixed

- **Edit: reject an empty `old_string`**
  ([#121](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/121),
  [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu)). An empty `old_string`
  matches between every character, so with `replace_all` it would inject
  the replacement throughout the file and corrupt it. The Edit tool now
  rejects it up front.

- **ChatGptCodex credentials detected from the auth file**
  ([#123](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/123),
  [@gobikom](https://github.com/gobikom)). `kind_has_credentials()` only
  probed env vars, but ChatGptCodex (ChatGPT subscription) authenticates
  via a file-based OAuth token — so it was wrongly reported as having no
  credentials, and interactive `--cli` / GUI / `--serve` triggered the
  model-fallback path and overwrote `settings.json`. It now resolves the
  Codex auth store (honoring token expiry), and the shared-session
  worker delegates to the same canonical check so all surfaces agree.

### Default model — no change

Default stays `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

## [0.17.1] — 2026-05-24

KMS + Files management in the GUI, a LINE reconnect fix, and a clearer
sandbox boundary message.

### Added

- **KMS sidebar create / rename / delete / edit.** The `+` buttons now
  open proper modals (the old `window.prompt`/`confirm` silently failed
  inside the wry webview): create a new KMS base (name + project/user
  scope), and create a new blank page (title / topic / category / tags)
  from the per-KMS browser panel. Right-click a page row to **Rename…**
  (moves the file and rewrites inbound links + the index) or
  **Delete…**. Edit the page you're viewing — a pencil opens the body
  in the TipTap editor plus a modal for the raw YAML frontmatter; Save
  writes it back.
- **Files tab create file / folder.** Right-click the explorer (or the
  new FilePlus / FolderPlus header buttons) for **New file…** /
  **New folder…**, created in the current directory via a name modal.
  Sandbox-checked; refuses to clobber an existing path. The explorer
  header now shows a compact `../<last>` path (full path on hover)
  since the viewer navbar already carries the full path.

### Fixed

- **LINE: reconnect storm after a clean websocket close**
  ([#120](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/120),
  [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu)). `LineClient::run` reset
  backoff and reconnected immediately on a clean close; a relay that
  closes cleanly on every connect spun an unthrottled connect/close
  loop. Adds a cancel-aware 1s pause mirroring the error path (shutdown
  still returns `Cancelled` promptly).

- **Clearer "outside the workspace" sandbox message**
  ([#119](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/119),
  [@ruzerix](https://github.com/ruzerix)). When a path resolves outside
  the workspace root, `Sandbox` now states plainly that this is a
  workspace-path boundary, **not** a permission/approval issue
  (approving a tool doesn't widen it). #119 turned out not to be a bug:
  a small model fabricated an out-of-workspace absolute interpreter
  path, the command failed as an ordinary shell error, and the model
  paraphrased it as "rejected by the security policy." The Bash tool
  description now steers models to invoke interpreters via PATH
  (e.g. `python script.py`) rather than guessing absolute paths.

### Default model — no change

Default stays `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-05-24

Two contributor-driven fixes: accurate Anthropic token/cost accounting,
and a remote-MCP `/mcp add` that no longer hangs (with API-key header
support).

### Added

- **`--header` on `/mcp add`** (part of
  [#118](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/118)).
  `/mcp add <name> <url> --header "Key: Value"` — repeatable, `-H`
  alias. Values support `${VAR}` interpolation resolved from the
  environment at connect time, so an API key lives in your shell /
  `.env` rather than plaintext in `mcp.json`:
  ```
  /mcp add financial-datasets https://mcp.financialdatasets.ai/api --header "X-API-KEY: ${FD_KEY}"
  ```

### Fixed

- **Anthropic token usage + prompt-cache accounting**
  ([#115](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/115),
  [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu)). The streaming parser read
  usage only from `message_delta` (which carries just `output_tokens`)
  and dropped `message_start.message.usage`, so every Anthropic turn
  reported `input_tokens = 0` and no cache stats — making `/cost` and
  the Cardputer cost display undercount the flagship provider. Now
  merges `message_start` usage into the terminal result (terminal
  `output_tokens` wins; cache fields preserved).

- **Remote MCP `/mcp add` no longer hangs; supports API-key auth**
  ([#114](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/114),
  [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu);
  [#118](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/118)). Adding an
  OAuth-gated remote server (e.g. financial-datasets' root URL) froze
  `/mcp add` for up to 5 minutes: the command ran the full connect
  inline, hit a 401, and blocked on the OAuth browser callback. Four
  fixes:
  - `--header` lets you use the API-key endpoint (`/api` + `X-API-KEY`)
    and skip OAuth entirely (see Added).
  - The auth probe and `oauth::discover` now have hard timeouts (15s
    request / 10s connect) so a stalled server can't hang the command
    or a startup spawn indefinitely.
  - `/mcp add` connects **non-interactively**: a server that needs
    OAuth returns "run `/mcp reauth <name>`" instead of blocking on a
    browser callback. The guard covers both the upfront probe and the
    bridge's `initialize`-time 401. Startup / `/mcp reauth` stay
    interactive (browser flow runs in the background as before).

### Default model — no change

Default stays `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-05-24

Hotfix. macOS startup crash for every GUI / `--serve` user.

### Fixed

- **macOS: GUI / `--serve` build crashed on startup (TCC / Bluetooth SIGABRT)**
  ([#116](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/116),
  [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu);
  [#117](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/117)).
  The `cost_bridge` feature (Cardputer cost display, added in v0.15.0)
  was enabled by default and started a Bluetooth LE scan on every
  launch via `cost_bridge::spawn()` → `adapter.start_scan()`. On
  macOS, any binary without an `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`
  `Info.plist` — every `cargo build` and every GitHub release archive
  (none are `.app` bundles) — is killed by **TCC** with a hard
  **SIGABRT** ~1–3s after startup, before serving any request. It also
  popped a Bluetooth permission prompt for the ~99% of users who don't
  own a thClaws-Cost Cardputer.
  - Fix: `cost_bridge` is now **opt-in** (`default = []`). A stock
    build never links `btleplug` or starts the BLE scan. Cardputer
    users build with `--features cost_bridge`.
  - No code changes — the call sites were already
    `#[cfg(feature = "cost_bridge")]`-gated.
  - **Affected releases v0.15.0 and v0.16.0**: macOS users on those
    versions should upgrade to v0.16.1, or run with
    `cargo run --no-default-features --features gui` as a workaround.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-05-23

Four user-facing fixes — three issue-driven, plus a Files-tab polish item
caught while drafting a deck.

### Fixed

- **Windows: GUI launch no longer blocks the cmd.exe / PowerShell prompt**
  ([#109](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/109),
  [@jubbyy](https://github.com/jubbyy);
  [#111](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/111)).
  Typing `thclaws.exe` from a shell on Windows 11 used to leave the
  prompt waiting until the GUI window closed. Root cause: PR #60 (May
  2026) deliberately built the binary as the **console subsystem** so
  `--cli`'s rustyline gets working stdio — the side effect was that
  cmd.exe / PowerShell `WaitForSingleObject` on every console-subsystem
  child, and `FreeConsole()` in the child can't undo that. Fix: at GUI
  dispatch entry on Windows, respawn `current_exe()` with
  `THCLAWS_GUI_DETACHED=1` and the `DETACHED_PROCESS` creation flag,
  then `exit(0)` the parent. The detached child runs the GUI in-process
  and survives parent / terminal closure; the parent exits in
  microseconds so cmd's wait returns. Placed before the in-process
  scheduler and `/v1` loopback bind so neither runs in the doomed
  parent (no port-bind race on 18443). Spawn failure (antivirus
  quarantine, ENOMEM, etc.) falls through to the in-process GUI run.
  No-op on macOS / Linux.

- **Agent: `max_tokens` escalation retry no longer rejected by claude-opus-4-7+**
  ([#112](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/112),
  [@siharat-th](https://github.com/siharat-th)).
  When the model hit `stop_reason=max_tokens` with no tool uses, the
  loop escalated `max_tokens` to 64000 and retried. The partial
  assistant message was already pushed to history, so the next
  `provider.stream` call's messages ended with `role=assistant` —
  which claude-opus-4-7+ rejects ("This model does not support
  assistant message prefill. The conversation must end with a user
  message."), failing the entire retry. Fix: pop the trailing
  assistant (guarded on `role == Assistant` so an empty assistant
  push is a no-op) before `continue`. The retry now sees a clean
  conversation ending in `role=user` and the model produces a
  complete response under the larger budget.

- **CLI: `--model` flag now reaches GUI and `--serve` modes**
  ([#110](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/110),
  [@dome](https://github.com/dome) — original diagnosis;
  [#113](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/113)).
  `thclaws --model X` was applied only by the CLI/REPL branch in
  `app.rs::main`, so the GUI and `--serve` paths silently ignored
  it. Fix: route `--model` through a process-global override that
  `AppConfig::load` applies last, after the project overlay — every
  dispatch surface (CLI, GUI, `--serve`, `--serve --gui`) now honors
  the flag without per-mode override plumbing. The GUI's
  auto-fallback path clears the override after switching to a
  working provider so a broken `--model` choice doesn't re-pin on
  every reload. Closes #110.

- **Files preview: relative `![alt](img/foo.png)` in markdown now renders.**
  Comrak emits `<img src="img/foo.png">` verbatim, and the iframe's
  `srcDoc` base URL is opaque, so relative paths had no directory to
  resolve against and failed silently. Fix: inject a
  `<base href="${origin}/file-asset/<dir>/">` into the rendered HTML
  before `srcDoc` so relative refs resolve via the same
  `/file-asset/` handler the `.html` branch already uses — same
  sandbox check, no backend changes.

### Added

- **`--set-model VALUE` flag**
  ([#113](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/113)).
  Persists a model to `.thclaws/settings.json` as the project
  default *and* uses it for the current run. Kept separate from
  `--model` (one-shot, in-memory) on purpose: a scripted
  `thclaws --print --model gpt-4-mini "quick"` shouldn't silently
  rewrite the default the user keeps for interactive work.
  Distinguishes "file missing" (safe to create — falls back to
  `ProjectConfig::load` so `.claude/settings.json` migrations
  preserve existing settings) from "file exists but unreadable"
  (bail with a clear error rather than silently nuking siblings
  like `maxTokens` / `allowedTools` / `kms.active` with a
  defaults-everywhere `ProjectConfig`). Save errors surface on
  stderr; success prints a green confirmation with the resolved
  path.

### Default model — no change

Default stays `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-27

Patch release. Two open-issue fixes plus a routine catalogue refresh.

### Fixed

- **Terminal slash-command popup cursor desync** ([#31](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/31),
  [@mrpokx5](https://github.com/mrpokx5)). After accepting a command via Tab
  or mouse click, the JS-side `cursorPos` stayed at its pre-accept value
  while the visible terminal cursor jumped to the end of the rewritten
  command. Subsequent keystrokes used the stale `cursorPos` to slice +
  splice `lineBuffer`, mangling the command name (the user's reported
  "selected but can do nothing" + "cursor misplaced on mouse click").
  Fix: assign `cursorPos = next.length;` after the buffer rewrite.
  Single line, three accept paths covered (Tab key, Enter when name
  still being composed, popup mouse onClick).

- **Retired Gemini models in catalogue** ([#32](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/32),
  [@jubbyy](https://github.com/jubbyy)). Reporter hit 404 on
  `gemini-2.0-flash`. Cross-checked against
  [Google's official deprecations page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/deprecations) —
  the model is in "existing-customer-only" since 2026-03-06 with hard
  shutdown 2026-06-01. Removed 7 retired rows from the catalogue:
  - `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro` (1.x family fully shut down 2025)
  - `gemini-2.0-flash`, `-001`, `-lite`, `-lite-001` (shutdown 2026-06-01)
  - `gemini-3-pro-preview` (already shut down 2026-03-09; replaced by `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`)

  Added `is_retired_gemini` filter in `catalogue-seed` so future
  `make catalogue` runs won't re-add them even though Google's upstream
  `/v1beta/models` still lists them for backward-compat. Verified the
  filter held against a live refresh — Gemini stayed at 10 rows. Comment
  in the filter points at Google's deprecations page so the next
  maintainer knows where to update.

### Catalogue

Routine refresh added 6 new model rows:

- **OpenRouter** — 5 new Qwen entries: `qwen/qwen3.5-plus-20260420`,
  `qwen/qwen3.6-{27b,35b-a3b,flash,max-preview}`.
- **Ollama Cloud** — `ollama-cloud/deepseek-v4-pro`.

Catalogue total now 589 rows (down 1 from v0.6.1's 590, net of the 7
retirements minus 6 additions).

### Default model — no change

The default Gemini model stays at `gemini-2.5-flash`. Considered switching
to Google's `gemini-flash-latest` rolling alias for auto-tracking, but
rejected — `-latest` could promote a higher-tier model into the alias
without warning, surprising users with unexpected cost. Convention
matches Anthropic / OpenAI defaults (pinned versioned IDs). Next bump
deadline: **2026-06-17** when `gemini-2.5-flash` retires per Google's
schedule. Comment near the default points at the deprecations page so
the next maintainer knows when to bump.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-27

Patch release. Three community PRs landed in quick succession after
v0.6.0 — a real cost optimization, a contributor-experience improvement,
and a new provider variant. All three fully tested, no breaking changes.

### Added — `OpenAICompat` provider ([#35](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/35), [@SalmonRK](https://github.com/SalmonRK))

A first-class slot for generic OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints — LLM
gateways like LiteLLM, Portkey, Helicone, internal corporate proxies,
self-hosted inference servers (vLLM, text-generation-inference,
lm-deploy), and any other service that speaks OpenAI's
`/v1/chat/completions` wire format with a Bearer token.

Mirrors the existing `LMStudio` / `DashScope` / `ZAi` /
`AzureAIFoundry` template — a configurable base URL (`OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL`
or Settings UI), Bearer token from `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY`, and a
`oai/<id>` model prefix that is stripped before the request reaches
the upstream. Real OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY` + `gpt-*` / `o*` models)
is unaffected — there is no env-var collision and no slot shadowing.

Usage:

```sh
# .env or shell
export OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
export OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY=...

# in REPL or via --model flag
/model oai/<upstream-model-id>
```

The `oai/` prefix is stripped before the wire payload, so an upstream
model named `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` is reached via
`/model oai/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct`.

### Added — Anthropic third cache breakpoint ([#33](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/33), [@chawasit](https://github.com/chawasit))

Adds a `cache_control: ephemeral` marker on the last content block of
the second-to-last message in `AnthropicProvider::build_body`, turning
the rolling conversation history into a cached prefix on subsequent
turns. The newest message stays uncached (it's the live user turn);
the one before it is byte-stable across the next call and becomes the
cache anchor.

Anthropic supports up to 4 `cache_control` markers per request. Before
this change we used 2 (system prompt + last tool definition); both
cached *fixed-size* blocks. The growing conversation history was
re-tokenized in full on every turn even though everything except the
newest user message was byte-stable across the next call.

Approximate input-cost reductions on Sonnet 4.6 vs. the prior
2-breakpoint setup:

| Session length × shape | Saving vs. 2 breakpoints |
|---|---|
| 10 turns, normal coding | ~46% |
| 10 turns, tool-heavy | ~54% |
| 30 turns, normal coding | ~74% |

Break-even is one cache hit: the 25% write surcharge is recovered
the next time the cached prefix is reused at 90% off. Anthropic's
1024-token minimum-cacheable-prefix floor is enforced server-side;
the client adds the marker only when the history has at least 3
messages (a soft-skip so the breakpoint slot isn't burned on
sub-1024-token histories that almost certainly won't qualify).

Three new tests cover the positive case, the short-history guard,
and a byte-stability invariant guarding against silent cache busts
from non-deterministic field ordering.

### Added — `scripts/build.{sh,ps1}` build helpers ([#34](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/34), [@chawasit](https://github.com/chawasit))

One-shot cross-platform build helpers. Default behavior: build the
frontend (`pnpm install` + `pnpm build`), then `cargo build --features
gui`. The Rust GUI build embeds `frontend/dist/index.html` at compile
time, so a bare `cargo build --features gui` without a prior frontend
build fails with a confusing missing-file error from `include_str!`.
The helpers enforce the order and surface a clear "you forgot to build
the frontend" message instead.

| `bash` | `PowerShell` | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/build.sh` | `scripts/build.ps1` | debug build (frontend + cargo) |
| `--release` | `-Release` | release profile |
| `--no-frontend` | `-NoFrontend` | skip pnpm steps; assume `frontend/dist` exists |
| `--check` | `-Check` | full verification suite (`cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -- -D warnings`, `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `cargo test`) |

Includes a `.gitattributes` that pins `*.sh` to LF and PowerShell /
batch files to CRLF so the bash script stays executable on Linux/macOS
even when the repo is checked out on Windows with `core.autocrlf=true`.
Without this, every Windows checkout would mangle the bash script's
shebang line and break it on POSIX hosts.

### Internal cleanup

- Two `clippy` warnings in `crates/core/build.rs` cleaned up
  (`collapsible_str_replace`, `manual_div_ceil`) — these were
  pre-existing from the v0.5.0 Phase 0 EE work and were noted in
  the PR descriptions of #33 and #34. `cargo clippy --fix` also
  applied 8 mechanical fixes across `repl.rs`, `skills.rs`,
  `providers/mod.rs`, `model_catalogue.rs`, `sso/discovery.rs`, and
  `bin/catalogue_seed.rs`. **505 lib tests pass.**

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-27

Minor release — Enterprise Edition Phase 4 (OIDC SSO) + admin
deployment UX. Open-core users see zero behavior change; every
feature below is inert unless a verified org policy with
`policies.sso.enabled` is loaded.

### Added — OIDC SSO (Phase 4)

- **Browser-driven OIDC authorization-code + PKCE flow.** Works
  against any standards-compliant IdP — Okta, Azure AD / Entra ID,
  Auth0, Keycloak, Google Workspace, AWS Cognito — selected by
  `policies.sso.issuer_url` in the active org policy. New module
  surface under `crates/core/src/sso/`:
  - `pkce.rs` — RFC 7636 verifier/challenge generator (32-byte
    OS-RNG verifier → SHA-256 → S256 challenge), RFC 7636 Appendix B
    test vector covered.
  - `discovery.rs` — fetches `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`,
    validates S256 PKCE support, decodes endpoints. One implementation,
    all IdPs.
  - `loopback.rs` — minimal HTTP listener on `127.0.0.1:<random>`
    (~60 lines `std::net`, no extra HTTP-server dep). Reads request
    line, extracts `code`/`state`/`error`, returns a friendly "you can
    close this tab" HTML page, shuts down. 5-minute timeout so a user
    who closes their browser doesn't hang the agent.
  - `storage.rs` — keychain persistence via the existing `secrets`
    module. Cache key is `thclaws-sso-<sha256-of-issuer>` so flipping
    IdPs doesn't pollute new claims with stale ones. Tokens never
    touch disk plaintext.
  - `mod.rs` — public API: `login`, `logout`, `current_session`,
    `current_access_token`, `status`, `decode_id_token_claims`. Token
    exchange via `reqwest`. Background refresh kicked off via
    `tokio::spawn` when within 60s of expiry. CSRF-safe `state` parameter
    refused on mismatch.

- **Slash commands**: `/sso`, `/sso login`, `/sso logout`, `/sso status`.
  Wired in both REPL and GUI dispatch.

- **GUI sidebar Identity section**. Three new IPC handlers
  (`sso_status` / `sso_login` / `sso_logout`) + a React component that
  renders only when the active policy has `sso.enabled`. Shows
  signed-in state with email + token-expiry pill + sign-out link, or
  not-signed-in state with a sign-in button. Open-core deployments
  never see the section at all.

- **Gateway `{{sso_token}}` substitution wired**. The Phase 3 gateway's
  auth-header template now resolves `{{sso_token}}` from the active
  SSO session at request time. Per-user identity flows through to the
  gateway audit log: instead of "device-token-X used claude-sonnet-4-6"
  the audit shows "alice@acme.com used claude-sonnet-4-6". Phase 3
  rendered this placeholder as empty string; v0.6.0 makes it active.

### Added — Policy schema (SsoPolicy fields)

- **`clientSecret`** (inline literal) — for "non-confidential" secrets
  that ship embedded in every binary copy by design (Google's Desktop
  OAuth being the canonical example, with Google's own docs explicitly
  classifying these as not-actually-secret). Recommended for those
  IdPs because it collapses the deploy story to "one signed file =
  one deployment artifact."

- **`clientSecretEnv`** (env var name) — for real confidential
  secrets that should never embed in deployed artifacts. The named env
  var is read at token-exchange time. Deploy via MDM / login script /
  OS keychain alongside the binary, in the same channel as the signed
  policy file.

  Resolution order: `clientSecret` (inline) → `clientSecretEnv` (env
  lookup) → none (PKCE-only public client). Each layer treats blank /
  missing as "not set" so a stray space or a left-over `=""` line in
  `.env` doesn't accidentally authenticate as the empty string.

### Added — Operator workflow (Make targets)

Six new Make targets that drive the EE lifecycle end-to-end:

- `make gen-key` — generates Ed25519 keypair at `thclaws-config/policy.{pub,key}`,
  chmod 600 on Unix, refuses to overwrite without `FORCE=1`.
- `make policy-google` — signed policy template targeting
  `accounts.google.com`, reads `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / optional
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from `.env`, embeds inline.
- `make policy-okta` — Okta tenant template, reads `OKTA_ISSUER_URL` /
  `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` / optional `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET`, uses
  `clientSecretEnv` (Okta secrets are real).
- `make policy-azure` — Azure / Entra template, reads `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
  / `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` / optional `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, builds the v2
  issuer URL automatically (`login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0`
  — v1 lacks the OIDC discovery doc).
- `make remove-key` — clears the public key + signed policy from the
  build-pickup path. Leaves the private key alone (admin may want to
  keep signing more policies). Idempotent. Useful for "build a clean
  open-core binary from this same checkout" workflows.
- `make remove-keypair FORCE=1` — destructive wipe of all keypair
  material. Refuses without `FORCE=1` because losing the private key
  means existing signed policies can't be re-signed.

Forward path (open-core → enterprise): `gen-key` → `policy-google` (or
`policy-okta` / `policy-azure`) → `make build`.
Backward path (enterprise → open-core): `remove-key` → `make build`.

### Added — Documentation

- **`docs/enterprise-make.md`** — canonical operator reference for the
  EE lifecycle. Covers prerequisites, target reference, lifecycle
  workflows (initial setup, re-sign, annual rotation, multi-customer
  pipeline, switching IdPs, going back to clean open-core),
  troubleshooting, file layout, and design principles.

- **`ENTERPRISE.md`** updated to reflect Phase 4 shipped: status table
  moved SSO from "Planned for v0.6.0" to "Shipped".

### Caveats

- **Live smoke confirmed against Google Workspace.** Okta and Azure
  templates are unit-tested with synthetic credentials but haven't
  been exercised against a real tenant. Any tenant-specific quirks
  surface in early customer feedback, not in this CHANGELOG.

- **Frontend hardcoded "thClaws" strings** in `App.tsx` /
  `ChatView.tsx` still aren't routed through the branding module —
  same caveat carried over from v0.5.0. Phase 4 covered the GUI
  Identity section but didn't expand the branding-IPC surface.

- **Tool-call audit (WebFetch / WebSearch URLs)** is still not
  gateway-routed. Those are general-purpose web fetches, not LLM
  provider calls, and intentionally bypass the gateway in v0.6.0. An
  admin who wants to gate them would do so at the network firewall
  level. A future sub-policy could add this if customers ask.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-27

Minor release. Lands the **Enterprise Edition foundation** (Phases 0–3
of `dev-plan/01-enterprise-edition.md`) — policy infrastructure,
branded builds, plugin/skill/MCP allow-list, and gateway enforcement.

**Open-core users see zero behavior change.** Every feature below is
inert unless an Ed25519-signed organization policy file is present at
`~/.config/thclaws/policy.json` or `/etc/thclaws/policy.json` *and*
verifies against either an embedded public key (enterprise builds) or
one supplied at runtime via env var / conventional file path.

### Added — Enterprise Edition foundation

- **Org policy file format** (Phase 0). New `policy/` module with a
  versioned JSON schema covering four sub-policies (branding, plugins,
  gateway, sso), Ed25519 signature verification using a hand-written
  canonical-JSON serializer (no external `canonical-json` dep), expiry
  checks, and optional `binding.binary_fingerprint` matching to prevent
  lifting a customer's policy onto a non-customer build. Loader searches
  `THCLAWS_POLICY_FILE` → `/etc/thclaws/policy.json` → `~/.config/thclaws/policy.json`.
  Public key sources: compile-time embedded → `THCLAWS_POLICY_PUBLIC_KEY`
  env var → `/etc/thclaws/policy.pub` → `~/.config/thclaws/policy.pub`.
  Open-core release binaries embed no key; enterprise builds bake the
  customer's public key at compile time via `THCLAWS_POLICY_PUBKEY_PATH`.
  Refuses to start on signature failure, expiry, binding mismatch, or
  missing verification key — fail-closed by design.

- **`thclaws-policy-tool` operator CLI** (Phase 0). Subcommands:
  `keygen` (generates Ed25519 keypair, chmods private key 0600 on Unix),
  `sign` (signs a policy JSON file), `verify` (checks signature
  against a public key), `inspect` (pretty-prints policy structure),
  `fingerprint` (computes SHA-256 of a binary for `binding`). Signing
  logic lives **only** in this tool — main runtime has zero signing
  code, so a leaked source tree isn't a key-compromise vector.

- **Branding config** (Phase 1). New `branding` module reads
  `policies.branding` from the active policy with fallback to today's
  defaults. Wired into the REPL banner, version header, `/doctor`
  diagnostics title, GUI window title, and the system prompt
  (`{product}` placeholder substituted at load time so the model
  introduces itself as the org's product name). `{support_email}`
  template substitution available for any prompt that needs it.

- **Plugin/skill/MCP source allow-list** (Phase 2). New
  `policy/allowlist.rs` matcher with host+path glob patterns,
  segment wildcards, host-prefix wildcards (`*.acme.example`), and
  mid-segment globs (`skill-*`). Strips scheme / query / fragment /
  port / `.git` suffix before matching. Wired at:
  - `plugins::install` — rejects URLs not in `allowed_hosts`
  - `skills::install_from_url` — same gate, covers both git and zip
    dispatch paths
  - `skills::enforce_scripts_policy` — rejects skills with non-empty
    `scripts/` dirs when `allow_external_scripts: false`. Bundle path
    rejects scripted skills individually so declarative siblings still
    install.
  - `config::parse_mcp_json` — filters HTTP MCP servers whose URL host
    isn't in `allowed_hosts` when `allow_external_mcp: false`. Logs
    yellow `[mcp] '<name>' skipped: <reason>` to stderr. Stdio MCPs
    pass through (admin's mcp.json content = admin's responsibility).

- **Gateway enforcement** (Phase 3). When `policies.gateway.enabled:
  true`, every cloud-provider call routes through the org's private
  LLM gateway (LiteLLM, Portkey, Helicone, internal proxy). User's
  per-provider API keys are ignored — gateway owns credentials.
  Architecture: `build_provider` returns a single OpenAI-compatible
  client pointing at the gateway URL when active, regardless of which
  `ProviderKind` the user picked. Works because every common gateway
  product speaks OpenAI Chat Completions and routes to upstream
  providers via the `model` field.
  - Auth header template supports `{{env:NAME}}` for env-var-injected
    secrets (keeps gateway tokens out of the auditable signed policy
    file). `{{sso_token}}` placeholder reserved for Phase 4.
  - `read_only_local_models_allowed: true` escape valve lets local
    providers (Ollama, OllamaAnthropic, LMStudio, AgentSdk) bypass
    the gateway and run directly. Off by default (strict enterprise).
  - Validation gate at policy load: refuses to start if
    `gateway.enabled: true` with empty `url` (would otherwise
    fail-open at provider construction). Same check for
    `sso.enabled: true` with empty `issuer_url` / `client_id`.

- **`ENTERPRISE.md`** admin guide added to the public repo. Covers
  the open-core + signed-policy architecture, 10-minute quick-start
  walkthrough, operational concerns (key rotation, expiry, binary
  fingerprint binding, MDM deployment), troubleshooting all four
  startup-refusal modes, and an FAQ.

### Caveats

- **OIDC SSO is not yet implemented.** Phase 4 lands in v0.6.0. Until
  then, the gateway uses static-token / env-var auth via the
  `{{env:NAME}}` template substitution. Works fine for LiteLLM-style
  deployments where the gateway token is the only required credential.
- **Frontend branding strings** (5 hardcoded "thClaws" literals in
  `App.tsx`/`ChatView.tsx`, plus the embedded React-bundled logo
  imports) are NOT yet routed through the branding module. They land
  in a v0.5.x point release once the IPC `branding_get` bridge is
  wired. The Rust-side branding (REPL banner, GUI title, system
  prompt) is fully active in v0.5.0.
- **HTTP-layer fail-closed** for the gateway is currently advisory.
  The provider-replacement approach already eliminates bypass paths
  inside the agent loop. A wrapper `reqwest::Client` for
  defense-in-depth is a planned hardening pass.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-26

Small additive release in response to issue [#30](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/30)
from Chawasit Tengtrairatana — same reporter who filed the
v0.4.1 Windows bug, with another high-quality writeup that
mapped cleanly to the existing catalogue layering.

### Added

- **User-defined context-window overrides.** A new `modelOverrides`
  block in `settings.json` (project + user, project wins per-key)
  lets the user pin context windows above every catalogue layer.
  Keyed by `provider/model` (e.g. `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`).
  Useful for: (a) capping a local Ollama / LMStudio model to fit
  a smaller GPU than the model's native context, (b) per-provider
  variants of the same id (Anthropic vs OpenRouter for the same
  Claude model), (c) brand-new models not yet in the catalogue.
  Override resolution honors aliases in both directions and the
  same `vendor/` prefix-strip rules the catalogue uses.

- **`/models set-context` and `/models unset-context` slash
  commands.** Set: `/models set-context [--project] <provider/model>
  <size>` (size accepts `128000`, `128k`, or `1m`). Unset: `/models
  unset-context [--project] <provider/model>`. Default scope is
  user-global (`~/.config/thclaws/settings.json`); `--project`
  scopes to `.thclaws/settings.json`. Saves preserve every other
  field in the target file (atomic write).

- **`ContextSource` enum.** `effective_context_window_with` now
  returns `(u32, ContextSource)` distinguishing override hits from
  catalogue hits and from fallbacks. `/models` rendering marks
  override rows with a `source: "override"` stamp. Old `(u32,
  bool)` semantics remain available via `ContextSource::is_known()`.

### Policy: trust + warn

Overrides exceeding the catalogue value are accepted (the user
intent always wins) but a yellow warning is printed at save-time
so a typo doesn't silently produce upstream rejections at request
time. No clamp, no validation against the upstream-reported max —
matches the spirit of "user knows their hardware better than we do."

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-27

Same-day patch release fixing a critical Windows-only bug surfaced
within hours of v0.4.0 shipping.

### Fixed

- **Bash tool unusable on Windows** ([#29](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/29),
  Chawasit Tengtrairatana). `/bin/sh` was hardcoded at 4 sites
  (`tools/bash.rs`, `team.rs`, `repl.rs`, `hooks.rs`) — Windows
  doesn't have that path, so spawn returned `os error 3` (path
  not found) and the agent was effectively crippled on Win11.
  Centralized shell resolution into `util::shell_command_{sync,
  async}()`, branching on `cfg!(windows)`. On Windows this is
  `cmd.exe /C <cmd>`; on Unix `/bin/sh -c <cmd>`, unchanged.

### Added

- **`THCLAWS_SHELL` env override.** Power users with `bash` from
  WSL / Git Bash, or who prefer `pwsh`, can set
  `THCLAWS_SHELL="bash -c"` (or `"pwsh -Command"`, etc.). The
  helper splits on whitespace into `(executable, flag)`. Useful on
  Windows where `cmd.exe` doesn't parse bash-syntax commands the
  same as `bash` does.

### Caveats

Bash-syntax commands the agent emits (`find . -name '*.rs'`,
single-quoted args, complex pipelines) may not parse identically
under `cmd.exe`. Set `THCLAWS_SHELL="bash -c"` if you have Git Bash
or WSL `bash` on `PATH` for closer-to-Unix semantics on Windows.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-27

Minor release. Provider expansion + agent-loop UX polish + a class
of bugs around credential detection. Substantial accumulated work
from same-day batch PR processing across 7 community contributors.

### Added — Providers (4 new)

- **Z.ai (GLM Coding Plan).** OpenAI-compatible upstream at
  `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`. Routes via `zai/<id>`
  prefix, default `zai/glm-4.6`. API key in `ZAI_API_KEY`. Power
  users on the BigModel SKU can override via `ZAI_BASE_URL`.
  Closes [#14](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/14).
- **LMStudio.** Local OpenAI-compatible runtime at `/v1`, default
  `http://localhost:1234/v1`. No auth. User-configurable base URL
  via Settings (mirrors the Ollama UX); env override
  `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL`.
- **Azure AI Foundry** ([#21](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/21),
  Parinya-chab / joparin). Anthropic-Claude-on-Azure via
  `{resource}/anthropic/v1/messages` with `x-api-key` auth. Reuses
  `AnthropicProvider` with a custom base URL — no duplicate stream
  code. Default model placeholder `azure/<deployment>` (Azure
  deployments are user-named); set via
  `/model azure/<your-deployment>` once `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`
  + `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` are configured. Forward-looking
  hooks added to `OpenAIProvider` (`with_api_key_header`,
  `with_list_models_url`) for a future Azure OpenAI provider.
- **Ollama Cloud** ([#28](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/28),
  Av0cadoo). Hits `https://ollama.com/api/chat` with Bearer auth;
  reuses local Ollama's NDJSON parser. Round-trips the cloud-
  specific `thinking` field as a sibling on assistant messages
  (DeepSeek V4, Kimi K2.5, GLM-5, etc. emit reasoning content
  separately from the visible answer). 38 cloud-only models
  auto-discovered via the new catalogue-seed probe — including
  `deepseek-v4-flash`, `kimi-k2.5/2.6`, `glm-5/5.1`,
  `qwen3-coder-next`, `mistral-large-3:675b`, `gpt-oss:20b/120b`.
  Closes [#17](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/17).

### Added — Agent-loop UX

- **AskUserQuestion GUI bridge** ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16),
  Kinzen-dev). The agent's `AskUser` tool used to fall through to
  invisible CLI stdin in the GUI — chat hung indefinitely. The
  question now appears as a chat-composer reply prompt; user
  reply routes back through a `oneshot` to the awaiting tool call.
  Falls back to CLI readline when no GUI is registered.
- **macOS Cmd+Q / Cmd+W shutdown shortcuts** ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16)).
  Two-layer coverage (frontend keydown listener + tao native
  KeyboardInput) so Cmd+Q reaches the SaveAndQuit save path even
  in fullscreen / focus-edge cases.
- **Post-key-entry model picker** ([#13](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/13)).
  After successfully saving an API key in Settings, if the
  provider has a non-trivial catalogue (≥3 models, skipping
  runtime-loaded backends), a searchable modal opens so the user
  can pick a default model.
- **`/model` interactive picker on no-args** ([#25](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/25),
  tkvision). Typing `/model` with no arguments now opens the
  same picker modal in addition to printing the current model.
  Reuses the post-key picker's UX. CLI-side TUI picker is a future
  follow-up.
- **Slash-command popup** ([#20](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/20),
  siharat-th). Typing `/` in chat or terminal opens an
  autocomplete menu — built-in commands grouped by category
  (Session / Model / Context / Extensions / Team / System), plus
  user `.claude/commands/` and installed skills. Arrow keys
  navigate, Tab/Enter accept, Esc cancels. Smart Enter: only
  swallows Enter while composing the command name, falls through
  to submit once arguments are being typed.
- **Terminal caret-aware editing** ([#22](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/22),
  siharat-th). Left/Right arrow keys, Home/End, Ctrl-A/Ctrl-E
  navigate the line buffer instead of echoing escape codes.
  Backspace and printable-char insertion are caret-aware: the
  fast `term.write(ch)` / `\b \b` path stays at end-of-line;
  mid-line edits redraw so the tail shifts correctly.

### Added — Catalogue

- **`agent/claude-opus-4-7-1m`** in the agent-sdk catalogue
  ([#26](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/26), tkvision).
  Max-subscription users on the `agent/*` provider can now
  explicitly select the 1M-context Opus variant.
- **Ollama Cloud auto-discovery** in `catalogue-seed`. Probes
  `https://ollama.com/v1/models` when `OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY` is
  set; refreshes 38 cloud rows every run.
- **`load_dotenv_walking_up()`** in `catalogue-seed` — walks up
  from cwd to find a workspace-root `.env`, so the operator tool
  picks up API keys regardless of which directory cargo is invoked
  from.

### Changed

- **Default Gemini model** `gemini-2.0-flash` → `gemini-2.5-flash`
  ([#27](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/27), gokusenz).
  Google's deprecation page lists 2.0-flash as deprecated with
  shutdown 2026-06-01. Existing user configs that explicitly pin
  2.0-flash still work.
- **Read tool** now errors out clearly when bytes don't match any
  supported image format (PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF) instead of guessing
  the MIME from the extension. Real images sniff fine; only the
  wrong-extension/corrupted unhappy path changes.

### Fixed

- **Empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` (or any provider key) was treated
  as configured.** `std::env::var(...).is_ok()` returns true for
  an exported-but-empty value, so a stale shell rc / VS Code env
  injection blocked `auto_fallback_model` from switching when the
  user added a Gemini/Z.ai/etc. key. Both `kind_has_credentials`
  and `api_key_from_env` now require non-empty values; empty env
  falls through to the keychain. Includes a regression test
  `empty_env_var_treated_as_unset`.
- **`/exit` / `/quit` / `/q` slash commands** route through
  the backend `app_close` save path
  ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16)) instead of
  frontend-only `window.close()` after a 200 ms timeout.
- **Tool-bubble finalizer** searches backwards for the most recent
  unfinished tool bubble — handles text events arriving between
  `tool_use` and `tool_done`
  ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16)).
- **Frontend security hardening** from a same-day audit pass:
  10 MB cap on pasted/dropped images with inline error banner
  (was: silent drop, multi-MB paste froze the UI during base64
  encoding); 1 MB cap on terminal clipboard paste; explanatory
  threat-model comment on the `ReactMarkdown` call site;
  `ansiToHtml` documented invariant block.
- **Backend security hardening:** IPC `chat_user_message`
  attachment array bounded at `MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_MESSAGE = 10`
  + 67 MB total b64.

### Infrastructure

- **Branch protection ruleset on `main`** — block force-push +
  deletion (non-admin), require PR before merging, require status
  checks (cargo fmt + clippy + test (ubuntu-latest) + audit) to
  pass. Admin bypass for sync-from-private-workspace flow and
  emergency corrections.
- **Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)** enabled. SECURITY.md
  refreshed: PVR primary, email alternate, supported versions
  bumped 0.2.x → 0.3.x → 0.4.x.
- **CodeQL default setup** for JavaScript/TypeScript + Actions.
- **`cargo-audit` workflow** runs on PRs touching `Cargo.lock` +
  weekly cron.
- **Node 24 actions runtime opt-in** via
  `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` ahead of GitHub's
  2026-06-02 forced switch.
- **`ci.yml` permissions block** — `contents: read, actions: read`
  at top level (was inheriting GITHUB_TOKEN's default write
  scope; closes 4 CodeQL alerts).

### Acknowledged but deferred

- Copy-button-on-chat-bubble surface scope decision (toast / scope
  restriction / pattern-redaction) — captured in the audit reports
  under `dev-log/103-security-audit-frontend.md`.
- IPC message types still stringly-typed; discriminated-union
  refactor queued.
- Transitive `glib` 0.18.5 / gtk-rs 0.18.x unmaintained warnings
  remain pending the upstream `wry`/`webkit2gtk` GTK4 migration.
- CLI TUI picker for `/model` no-args
  ([#25](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/25)) — GUI
  side ships in this release; CLI is future work.
- GitHub Copilot provider
  ([#24](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/24)) — needs
  GitHub OAuth web flow; queued for a future minor.
- `output.log` should record tool-call argument detail
  ([#23](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/23)).

## [0.3.5] — 2026-04-26

Same-day feature/fix follow-up to v0.3.4: two new providers, the
post-key-entry model picker, plus a real bug fix for users whose
shell rc / VS Code env injects a blank `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### Added

- **Z.ai (GLM Coding Plan) provider.** OpenAI-compatible upstream
  at `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`. Models route via
  `zai/<id>` prefix (default `zai/glm-4.6`). API key in
  `ZAI_API_KEY`. Power users on the BigModel SKU can override the
  endpoint via `ZAI_BASE_URL`. Closes [#14](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/14).
- **LMStudio provider.** Local-runtime, OpenAI-compatible at `/v1`.
  No auth. User-configurable base URL via Settings (default
  `http://localhost:1234/v1`); env override `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL`.
  Mirrors the Ollama UX so changing port doesn't require a
  settings.json edit.
- **Post-key-entry model picker** ([#13](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/13)).
  After successfully saving an API key in Settings, if the
  provider has a non-trivial catalogue (≥3 models, skipping
  runtime-loaded backends like Ollama/LMStudio), a searchable
  modal opens so the user can pick a default model directly —
  instead of landing on whatever `auto_fallback_model` chose.
  Skip / Esc / click-outside leaves the auto-pick in place.
- **AskUserQuestion GUI bridge** ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16),
  Kinzen-dev). The agent's `AskUser` tool used to fall through to
  invisible CLI stdin in the GUI — chat hung indefinitely. The
  question now appears as a chat-composer reply prompt; user
  reply routes back through a `oneshot` to the awaiting tool call.
  Falls back to CLI readline when no GUI is registered.
- **macOS Cmd+Q / Cmd+W shutdown shortcuts** ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16)).
  Two-layer coverage (frontend keydown listener + tao native
  KeyboardInput) so Cmd+Q reaches the SaveAndQuit save path even
  in fullscreen / focus-edge cases.

### Fixed

- **Empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` (or any provider key) was treated
  as configured.** `std::env::var(...).is_ok()` returns true for an
  exported-but-empty value, so a stale shell rc / VS Code env
  injection blocked `auto_fallback_model` from switching when the
  user added a Gemini/Z.ai/etc. key. Both `kind_has_credentials`
  and `api_key_from_env` now require non-empty values; empty env
  falls through to the keychain. Includes a regression test
  (`empty_env_var_treated_as_unset`).
- **`catalogue-seed` reads workspace-root `.env`.** When invoked
  via `cargo run --bin catalogue-seed` from a nested crate dir,
  the binary now walks up from cwd to find the workspace's `.env`
  and load API keys from it. Added
  `dotenv::load_dotenv_walking_up()`.
- **Tool-bubble finalizer searches backwards for unfinished tools**
  ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16)). Old code
  assumed `messages[last]` was the matching tool bubble; failed
  when text or other events arrived between `tool_use` and
  `tool_done`.
- **`/exit` / `/quit` / `/q` slash commands** now route through
  the backend `app_close` save path ([#16](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/16))
  instead of frontend-only `window.close()` after a 200 ms timeout.

### Internal

- New `model_set` IPC handler — frontend-driven model change path,
  used by the new picker; mirrors what `/model` does in the agent
  loop. Available for any future picker UI.
- Dotenv `load_dotenv_walking_up(start)` helper exposed for
  operator-tool scenarios.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-04-26

Same-day hardening patch following an internal security audit of v0.3.3.
No new features; all changes are defensive limits and clearer errors on
the image-attachment and terminal-paste paths.

### Added

- **Inline error feedback on image attachment.** Pasting or dropping an
  unsupported image type or an image larger than 10 MB now shows a
  short auto-clearing banner ("Image too large: 17.3 MB (max 10 MB)")
  instead of silently dropping. Same path covers
  `image/svg+xml`/etc. → "Unsupported image type".

### Changed

- **Read tool errors cleanly on wrong-extension image files.** Files
  like `screenshot.png` containing non-PNG bytes used to slip through
  with a guessed MIME and get rejected by the provider with an opaque
  400. They now fail at Read with a pointed error message
  ("bytes don't match any supported image format despite extension
  claiming image/png — file may be corrupted, encrypted, or saved
  with the wrong extension"). Real images with these extensions are
  unaffected.

### Fixed (security hardening)

- **ChatView image paste/drop:** 10 MB per-attachment cap. Above the
  cap, the image is rejected with a visible error rather than ballooning
  the IPC payload and freezing the UI during base64 encoding.
- **TerminalView clipboard paste:** 1 MB cap. Multi-MB pastes used to
  freeze the main thread during synchronous `atob()` + `TextDecoder`;
  oversized pastes are now dropped with a console warning.
- **Backend IPC `chat_user_message` attachment array:**
  `MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_MESSAGE = 10` and a 67 MB combined-base64 cap.
  Defense-in-depth against a malicious or buggy frontend bypassing
  the per-image cap; worst-case payload now bounded at ~50 MB raw
  per message rather than unbounded.
- **`TeamView.tsx` `ansiToHtml`:** documented the escape-first
  invariant in a JSDoc block. The function's output is consumed via
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; preserving HTML-escape-before-tag-build
  ordering is what keeps it safe. Block lists three changes to NOT
  make.
- **Markdown rendering threat-model comment** added at the
  `ReactMarkdown` call site documenting that `msg.content` is
  untrusted model output and the configured plugin chain
  (`remark-gfm`, `rehype-highlight`) is intentionally the safe stack
  — no `allowDangerousHtml`, no `rehype-raw`.

### CI / Infrastructure

- **Workflow least-privilege.** `ci.yml` now declares an explicit
  top-level `permissions: contents: read, actions: read`, instead of
  inheriting the GITHUB_TOKEN's default write scope. Closes 4
  CodeQL alerts (`actions/missing-workflow-permissions`).
- **CodeQL Rust scan** actually runs now: added `libdbus-1-dev` +
  `pkg-config` install before `cargo build`. The keychain crate's
  transitive `libdbus-sys` was failing pkg_config detection, breaking
  every prior CodeQL Rust run before extraction even started.
- **Node 24 actions runtime opt-in** via
  `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` on both `release.yml`
  and `ci.yml`. Surfaces any action-runtime breakage on our schedule
  rather than at GitHub's 2026-06-02 forced cutover.

### Known issues — acknowledged but deferred

- Copy-button surface on chat bubbles (system/tool/assistant) doesn't
  warn or filter when copying messages that may contain previously-
  pasted secrets. Needs a design choice (toast confirmation vs.
  scope restriction vs. pattern-based redaction); deferred to v0.3.5.
- IPC message types are still stringly-typed; discriminated-union
  refactor queued for a future maintenance pass.
- Transitive `glib` 0.18.5 / gtk-rs 0.18.x unmaintained warnings
  (12 RustSec entries) remain pending the upstream `wry`/`webkit2gtk`
  GTK4 migration.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-04-26

Feature release rolling up image attachment across providers, chat UI
polish, and a community-PR sweep that ran `pnpm lint` to clean. Plus
a transitive postcss XSS patch and a docs-prerequisite correction.

### Added

- **Image attachment across providers.** The Read tool now returns
  inline images for vision-capable models (PNG/JPG/GIF/WebP). Wire
  shaping is per-provider:
  - **Anthropic** — native via serde, zero provider code.
  - **OpenAI** — synthetic user message with `image_url` blocks
    referencing the originating `tool_call_id` (their tool-role
    messages can't carry images).
  - **Gemini** — `inlineData` parts as siblings to `functionResponse`
    in the same content.
  - **Ollama / OpenAI Responses** — text-only flatten on wire (no
    pixels to model).
- **ChatView attachments.** Paste and drag-drop image files into the
  chat composer; thumbnails preview before send.

### Changed

- **Chat rendering.** Assistant turns render as markdown
  (headings/lists/code/tables) instead of raw text. Tool output
  collapses to compact one-line indicators by default, with errors
  always shown in full.
- **Tool result handling on history restore.** `tool_result` blocks
  are dropped on session reload; `tool_use` rendering is unified
  across the streaming and reload paths.

### Fixed

- **postcss 8.5.9 → 8.5.10** ([GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93)).
  Transitive frontend dep; thClaws ships pre-compiled Tailwind so
  runtime exposure was minimal but Dependabot was flagging.
- **Documented Rust prerequisite: 1.78 → 1.85** in user-manual.
  The `home` crate v0.5.12 (transitive) needs edition 2024, so the
  effective MSRV moved to 1.85. README + CONTRIBUTING were already
  updated in [#3](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/3); this
  catches the user-manual files that PR missed.
- **Read tool: image format sniffing from magic bytes** instead of
  trusting file extensions (which lie often enough — `.jpg` files
  that are actually PNGs, etc.).
- **OpenAI batched tool messages.** Emit batched tool messages
  back-to-back with a single combined image follow-up, instead of
  interleaving.
- **Sidebar.tsx unreachable branch.** Duplicate `sessions_list`
  `else if` removed (#4).
- **Frontend lint sweep** by [@parintorns](https://github.com/parintorns)
  in #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10 — `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`,
  `react-refresh/only-export-components`, `no-empty`, type safety
  in IPC bridge and TeamView. `pnpm lint` is now clean.
- **`.gitignore`: `.thclaws/sessions/` → `.thclaws/`.** Was leaking
  `team/`, `settings.json`, and similar runtime files into
  `git status` (#6).

### Infrastructure

- **Workspace `Cargo.toml` at repo root** by
  [@bombman](https://github.com/bombman) (#2). `cargo build` now
  works from the repo root as the README documents; build output
  is at `target/release/` instead of `crates/core/target/release/`.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-25

Patch release fixing two GUI startup-recovery bugs surfaced in the
hours after v0.3.1 shipped. Both reach the user before they've typed
their first prompt, so this release is recommended for everyone on
v0.3.1 — particularly Linux users, who can't launch v0.3.1 at all.

### Fixed

- **Linux GUI startup panic.** v0.3.1 panicked at startup on every
  Linux build with `webview build: UnsupportedWindowHandle`
  (reported on Ubuntu 22.04). `wry` can't construct a WebKit2GTK
  webview from a raw window handle the way it does on macOS / Windows
  — WebKit2GTK is a GTK widget that has to be packed into a GTK
  container. Fixed by switching to `wry`'s Linux-only
  `build_gtk(window.default_vbox().unwrap())` behind
  `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`. The cross-platform path is preserved
  for macOS / Windows. (commits 6171815 by @Phruetthiphong + 729538b)
- **First-time API key setup required an app restart.** Pasting a
  provider key in Settings on a fresh install would update the sidebar
  to show the new provider, but the running agent kept holding the
  stale (or no-op) provider it was constructed with at startup —
  resulting in "sidebar shows openai but error mentions anthropic"
  on the first send. Two fixes:
  - The shared-session worker no longer exits on missing-key startup;
    it installs a `NoopProvider` placeholder and stays alive so a
    later config reload can swap in a real provider.
  - Added `ShellInput::ReloadConfig`. The `api_key_set` and
    `api_key_clear` IPC handlers now send it after their save, so the
    worker reloads `AppConfig`, rebuilds the agent's provider in
    place, and broadcasts the sidebar update — all without an app
    restart. (commit 27d163d)

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-25

Re-release of v0.3.0 — the v0.3.0 tag's release workflow failed
(missing `banner.txt` broke the frontend build). Tag re-cut against
the fix.

### Fixed (v0.3.1 vs v0.3.0)

- **`banner.txt` now ships in the repo** so `vite build` resolves
  `import bannerText from "../../../banner.txt?raw"` in
  `TerminalView.tsx`. v0.3.0 release job failed at this step on every
  platform.
- **`cargo fmt` drift** in `crates/core` cleaned up so the CI fmt
  check passes.
- **`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/upload-artifact`,
  `actions/download-artifact` bumped to v5** for Node 24 support
  (v4 is now deprecated on GitHub-hosted runners).

### Providers (since v0.2.2)

- Reasoning-model support end-to-end: DeepSeek v4-flash/pro, DeepSeek r1,
  OpenAI o-series via OpenRouter. `reasoning_content` is captured into a
  Thinking content block and echoed back on subsequent turns (these
  providers 400 without it). Conservative allowlist — non-thinking models
  pay zero extra tokens.
- Provider-aware alias resolution: agent-def `model: sonnet` stays in
  the project's current provider namespace instead of surprise-switching
  to native Anthropic.
- Model catalogue v3 (provider-keyed maps, real ids, per-row provenance).
  `/models` reads from catalogue; `/model` auto-scans Ollama context
  window.

### Agent Teams (since v0.2.2)

- Sandbox boundary anchors to `$THCLAWS_PROJECT_ROOT` (not cwd); worktree
  teammates can write shared artifacts at workspace root; `Write` into
  deep new trees walks up to the longest existing ancestor.
- "Project settings win" on cwd change: GUI reloads `ProjectConfig` and
  rebuilds the agent; worktree teammates pick up the workspace's
  `settings.json` (was silently falling back to user config).
- Role guards on `Bash` / `Write` / `Edit`:
  - Lead can't run `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git worktree remove`,
    `git push --force`, `git checkout -- …`, or `Write` / `Edit` source
    files. One narrow exception: when a merge is in progress and the
    target file has `<<<<<<<` markers, lead may write the resolved
    content (so package.json-style conflicts can be handled without
    delegating).
  - Teammates can't `git reset --hard <other-branch>`. Same-branch
    recovery (`HEAD~N`, sha, tags) stays allowed.
- `EDITOR` / `GIT_EDITOR` / `VISUAL` / `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` stubbed to
  `true` for teammates so `vi` / `git commit -e` don't hang waiting for
  input via `/dev/tty`.
- "Plan Approval" convention documented in default `lead.md` /
  `agent_team.md` prompts (lead↔teammate handshake, NOT a user gate).
- `TeamTaskCreate` gains an `owner` field; `claim_next` is role-aware.

### GUI (since v0.2.2)

- Terminal tab: Up/Down arrow prompt history.
- Files tab: WYSIWYG round-trip for `.md` preview + editor; HTML preview
  base-URL fix; off-screen edit-button positioning fix.
- Approval modal; MCP spawn through approval sink; `ReadyGate` for
  deferred startup so the worker accepts prompts before MCP-spawn
  approval returns.
- Context warning banner + per-file size breakdown of the system prompt.
- Settings menu polish: accent-tinted hover + focus highlight; modal
  backdrop dismiss on mousedown-origin (fewer accidental closes).
- Windows GUI fixes backported from upstream: `rfd` file picker,
  `native_dialog` confirm, `ospath()` path-separator helper.

### KMS

- `/kms ingest` slash command; sidebar refreshes live on KMS changes.

### Catalogue tooling

- New `make catalogue` target wraps `catalogue-seed` with a diff-stat
  preview and a per-provider transparency report (new IDs added +
  unchanged + skipped-no-context counts).

### User manual — NEW in this release

- 17-chapter reference manual in English (`user-manual/`) and Thai
  (`user-manual-th/`) with shared images at `user-manual-img/`. Covers
  installation through agent teams. Case-study chapters (18–24) for
  building/deploying real projects remain in workspace draft and will
  graduate to the published manual as each is reviewed.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Shared in-process session backing both GUI tabs.** Terminal and Chat tabs now share one Agent + Session + history; typing in either contributes to the same conversation, and `/load` replays the transcript into both.
- **Every REPL slash command works from the GUI.** `/model`, `/provider`, `/permissions`, `/thinking`, `/compact`, `/doctor`, `/mcp`, `/plugin`, `/skill`, `/kms`, `/team`, and the rest all execute identically in Terminal, Chat, and CLI.
- **Live activation for mutations** (no restart required): `/mcp add` spawns the subprocess and registers its tools; `/skill install` refreshes the store and updates the system prompt; `/plugin install` picks up plugin-contributed skills immediately; `/kms use` / `/kms off` register and deregister tools on the fly.
- **Agent Teams toggle in the Settings menu** — one-click on/off for `teamEnabled` without editing `settings.json`.
- **Light/dark/system theme** — click the gear icon → Appearance. Covers app chrome, xterm terminal palette, CodeMirror editor, and Markdown preview; persists to `~/.config/thclaws/theme.json`.
- **Files-tab viewer + editor** — syntax-highlighted preview (CodeMirror 6, ~40 languages), GFM markdown preview (comrak), TipTap markdown editor, CodeMirror code editor with dirty-state tracking and Cmd/Ctrl+S save.
- **Chat tab welcome logo.** Team tab is always visible with an empty-state pointer.

### Fixed

- **Windows startup hang at the secrets-backend dialog.** Every `std::env::var("HOME")` site now goes through a cross-platform `home_dir()` helper that understands `%USERPROFILE%` and `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`. Previously the silent `Error::Config("HOME is not set")` left the user staring at a silently re-enabled button.
- **Multi-line paste in Terminal tab** submits as one prompt instead of firing one `shell_input` per line.
- **Terminal assistant output concatenates** during streaming — previously each chunk erased the previous one.
- **ANSI escape codes stripped from Chat bubbles** — slash-command output (`render_help`) no longer shows `[2m...[0m` junk.
- **Ctrl+C on empty line cancels the in-flight turn** (was a no-op after the shared-session refactor).
- **Team tab auto-shows** after `TeamCreate` — no longer gated on `teamEnabled`.
- **`/provider X` falls back to the first available model** if the hardcoded default isn't in the live catalogue. `/model X` stays strict so typos fail loud.
- **System-prompt grounding on `agent/*` provider** — the SDK subprocess doesn't receive thClaws's tool registry; when the user asks for teams from `agent/*`, the model is told honestly that team tools are unreachable and to switch provider.

### Removed

- **`managed/*` (Anthropic Managed Agents cloud) provider.** The Managed Agents API is designed for deploying long-running agents to Anthropic's cloud with server-side tool execution — a poor fit for a local interactive CLI where tool calls should hit the user's filesystem.

### Diagnostics

- `THCLAWS_DEVTOOLS=1` opens the WebView devtools so users can Inspect → Console on a blank screen.
- Startup modal shows a diagnostic card after 3 seconds of IPC dead-air, listing `window.ipc` availability, platform, and UserAgent — instead of an indefinite blank screen.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-21

First public open-source release — version and date will be set on tag.

### Agent core

- **Native Rust agent loop** — single-binary distribution for macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Streaming provider abstraction** — token-by-token output to the UI, tool-use assembly across chunks
- **History compaction** — automatic when context approaches the configured budget, preserves semantic coherence
- **Permission modes** — `auto`, `ask`, `accept-all` with per-tool approval flow
- **Hooks** — shell commands triggered on agent lifecycle events (before-tool, after-response, etc.)
- **Retry loop with exponential backoff** — skips retries on config errors to surface actionable messages immediately
- **Max-iteration cap** — prevents runaway tool-call loops
- **Compatible session format** (JSONL, append-only) with rename and load-by-name

### Providers

- **Anthropic Claude** — with extended thinking (budget-configurable), prompt caching, and Claude Code CLI bridge
- **OpenAI** — Chat Completions and Responses API
- **Google Gemini** — including multi-byte-safe streaming
- **DashScope / Qwen**
- **Ollama** (local, also exposed as Ollama-Anthropic for drop-in compatibility)
- **Agentic Press LLM gateway** — first-class provider with fixed URL
- **Multi-provider switching mid-session** via `/provider` and `/model`
- **Model validation** — `/model NAME` verifies availability against the active provider before committing
- **Auto-fallback at startup** — picks the first provider with credentials if the configured model has no key

### Tools

- File: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Ls`, `Grep`
- Shell: `Bash` (with timeout, sandboxed cwd)
- Web: `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` (Tavily / Brave / DuckDuckGo / auto)
- User interaction: `AskUserQuestion`, `TodoWrite`
- Planning: `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode`
- Delegation: `Task` (subagent with recursion up to `max_depth`)
- Knowledge: `KmsRead`, `KmsSearch`
- Team coordination: `SpawnTeammate`, `SendMessage`, `CheckInbox`, `TeamStatus`, `TeamCreate`, `TeamTaskCreate`, `TeamTaskList`, `TeamTaskClaim`, `TeamTaskComplete`
- Tool filtering via `allowedTools` / `disallowedTools` in config

### Claude Code compatibility

- Reads `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` (walked up from `cwd`)
- `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/commands/`
- `.thclaws/` counterparts: `.thclaws/skills/`, `.thclaws/agents/`, `.thclaws/rules/`, `.thclaws/AGENTS.md`, `.thclaws/CLAUDE.md`
- `.mcp.json` at project root (primary) and `.thclaws/mcp.json`
- `~/.claude/settings.json` fallback for users migrating from Claude Code
- Permission shapes: string (`"auto"` / `"ask"`) and Claude Code object (`{allow, deny}` with `Tool(*)` globs)

### Built-in KMS (Knowledge Management System)

- Karpathy-style personal / project wikis under `~/.config/thclaws/kms/` and `.thclaws/kms/`
- Multi-select active list in `.thclaws/settings.json` — multiple KMS feed a single chat
- `index.md` injected into the system prompt; pages pulled on demand via `KmsRead` / `KmsSearch`
- No embeddings in v1 (grep + read); hosted embeddings planned for future RAG upgrade
- Slash commands: `/kms`, `/kms new [--project] NAME`, `/kms use`, `/kms off`, `/kms show`
- Sidebar checkbox UI for attach / detach

### Agent Teams

- Multi-agent coordination via tmux session with a GUI layer
- Role separation: `lead` coordinator + `teammate` executors
- Mailbox-based message passing
- Team tasks (create / list / claim / complete)
- Opt-in via `teamEnabled: true` in settings
- Worktree isolation — teammates can run in separate git worktrees

### Plugin system

- Install from git URL or `.zip` archive
- Enable / disable / show
- Plugins contribute skills, commands, agents, and MCP servers under one manifest
- Project-scope and user-scope installations
- `/plugin` slash command family (install / remove / enable / disable / show)

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- stdio transport (spawned subprocess)
- HTTP Streamable transport
- OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for protected MCP servers
- `/mcp add [--user] NAME URL`, `/mcp remove [--user] NAME`
- Discovered tools namespaced by server name

### Skills

- Claude Code's skill format (`SKILL.md` with frontmatter)
- Project, user, and plugin scopes (all merged)
- Exposed as a `Skill` tool AND as slash-command shortcuts (`/skill-name`)
- `/skill install [--user] <git-url-or-.zip> [name]` for installing remote skills
- Skill catalog surfaced in the system prompt

### Desktop GUI

- Native `wry` webview + `tao` windowing (not Electron)
- React + Vite frontend built as a single HTML file
- Sidebar: provider status, active model, sessions, MCP servers, knowledge bases
- Chat panel with streaming text rendering
- xterm.js terminal tab with native clipboard bridge (`arboard`) — Cmd/Ctrl+C/X/V/A/Z
- Ctrl+C heuristic: clears current line when non-empty, otherwise passes SIGINT
- Files tab
- Team view tab (tmux pane preview)
- Settings menu (gear popup): Global instructions, Folder instructions, Provider API keys
- Tiptap-based Markdown editor for AGENTS.md (round-trip through `tiptap-markdown`)
- Startup folder modal — pick working directory on launch
- Provider-ready indicator (green / red dot + strike-through when no key)
- Auto-switch model to a working provider when a key is saved
- Session rename with inline pencil button; `/load by name`
- Turn duration display after each assistant response

### Memory

- Persistent memory store at `~/.config/thclaws/memory/`
- Four memory types: user, feedback, project, reference
- `MEMORY.md` index auto-maintained
- `/memory list`, `/memory read NAME`
- Frontmatter-based classification so future conversations recall relevance

### Secrets & security

- OS keychain integration (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service)
- **Secrets-backend chooser** — first launch asks OS keychain or `.env`
- Single-entry keychain bundle — all provider keys in one item, one ACL prompt per launch
- `.env` fallback when keychain is unavailable (e.g. headless Linux)
- Cross-process key visibility — GUI and PTY-child REPL read the same keychain entry
- Precedence: shell export > keychain > `.env` file
- Sandboxed file tool operations (path-traversal rejection)
- Permission system protects destructive operations
- Env toggles: `THCLAWS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN` (test opt-out), `THCLAWS_KEYCHAIN_TRACE` (diagnostics)

### Observability

- Per-provider, per-model token usage tracking (`/usage`)
- Turn duration surfaced after each LLM response
- Optional raw-response dump to stderr (`THCLAWS_SHOW_RAW=1`)
- Keychain trace logs for cross-process debugging

### Developer experience

- Slash commands: `/help`, `/clear`, `/history`, `/model`, `/models`, `/provider`, `/providers`, `/config`, `/save`, `/load`, `/sessions`, `/rename`, `/memory`, `/mcp`, `/plugin`, `/plugins`, `/tasks`, `/context`, `/version`, `/cwd`, `/thinking`, `/compact`, `/doctor`, `/skills`, `/skill`, `/permissions`, `/team`, `/usage`, `/kms`
- Shell escape: `! <command>` runs a shell command inline
- `--print` / `-p` non-interactive mode for scripting
- `--resume SESSION_ID` (or `last`) to pick up where you left off
- `--team-agent NAME` for spawning teammates
- Graceful startup — REPL opens with a friendly placeholder if no API key is configured
- Dual CLI + GUI from the same binary
- Compile-time default prompts with `.thclaws/prompt/` overrides
