# Chapter 2 — Installation

thClaws ships as two peer binaries: `thclaws` (desktop GUI + CLI, the
primary entrypoint) and `thclaws-cli` (CLI only, for headless / SSH /
scripted use). Both are built from the same engine — pick whichever
matches how you launch. Download the build that matches your OS and
CPU from:

**https://thclaws.ai/downloads.html**

Builds are provided for:

| OS | Architectures |
|---|---|
| macOS | Apple Silicon (`arm64`), Intel (`x86_64`) |
| Linux | `x86_64`, `arm64` |
| Windows | `x86_64`, `arm64` |

Pick the right macOS build:

- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4/M5)**: use the `arm64` build. The `x86_64`
  build *does* run via Rosetta 2, but the native `arm64` build is
  faster and uses less memory.
- **Intel Macs**: use the `x86_64` build. The `arm64` build won't run
  on Intel.

## System requirements

thClaws itself is small — the binary is ~20 MB unpacked and uses
~250–400 MB of RAM at runtime, most of it the embedded webview
supplied by the operating system (WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on
Windows, WebKit2GTK on Linux).

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **OS** | macOS 12+ · Windows 10+ · Linux with webkit2gtk-4.1 (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 38+) | latest stable |
| **CPU** | any 64-bit x86_64 or ARM64 from the past ~10 years | modern multi-core |
| **RAM** | 2 GB free | 8 GB total |
| **Disk** | ~50 MB | SSD |
| **Network** | required for cloud providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter / Z.ai / DashScope / Agentic Press); optional if you only use local Ollama or LMStudio | broadband |

If you're using thClaws purely against cloud providers, any laptop
bought in the past few years works comfortably. The heavy spec floor
for **local** model use is the model runtime (Ollama / LMStudio),
not thClaws — see [Optional: Ollama for fully local use](#optional-ollama-for-fully-local-use)
below for those numbers.

> **Prefer to build from source?** thClaws is open source — clone
> [github.com/thClaws/thClaws](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws)
> and run `cargo build --release --features gui` (Rust 1.85+,
> Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+). The downloads below are the recommended
> install route for most users.

## Install

### macOS

**Recommended — universal `.dmg` installer**

1. Download `thclaws-<version>-universal-apple-darwin.dmg`. One file
   covers both Apple Silicon and Intel — no architecture pick needed.
2. Double-click the `.dmg`, then drag **thClaws** into the
   **Applications** folder when the installer window appears.
3. Open thClaws from Launchpad or Spotlight. On first launch,
   Gatekeeper may say "thClaws can't be opened because Apple cannot
   check it for malicious software" — click **OK**, then in **System
   Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message about
   thClaws and click **Open Anyway**. macOS will remember the choice.
4. The desktop app installs a `thclaws` and `thclaws-cli` CLI shim on
   `$PATH` on first launch (via the **Install CLI tools** menu item if
   it doesn't happen automatically). After that, both `thclaws` and
   `thclaws-cli` work from any terminal.

That's it — no `PATH` editing, no `xattr` cleanup.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual install (fallback)</strong> — for headless / SSH / scripted boxes where the GUI installer can't run.</summary>

1. Download the architecture-specific tarball:
   `thclaws-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (Apple Silicon) or
   `thclaws-<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (Intel).
2. Extract and move the binary onto your `PATH`:

   ```bash
   $ tar -xzf ~/Downloads/thclaws-*-apple-darwin.tar.gz
   $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   $ mv thclaws thclaws-cli ~/.local/bin/
   $ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/thclaws ~/.local/bin/thclaws-cli
   ```

3. If `~/.local/bin` isn't on your `PATH`, add this to `~/.zshrc`
   (or `~/.bashrc`) and restart your terminal:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

4. Clear the Gatekeeper quarantine flag one-time so the binary can run:

   ```bash
   $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/thclaws ~/.local/bin/thclaws-cli
   ```

</details>

### Linux

1. Download `thclaws-<version>-<arch>-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`.
2. Extract and install:

   ```bash
   $ tar -xzf ~/Downloads/thclaws-*-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   $ install -m 755 thclaws thclaws-cli ~/.local/bin/
   ```

3. Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH` (most distros already do
   this via `~/.profile`; if not, add the `export PATH=...` line from
   the macOS section).

### Windows

**Recommended — `.msi` installer**

1. Download the matching `.msi`:
   - **`thclaws-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.msi`** for Intel /
     AMD Windows (the typical case).
   - **`thclaws-<version>-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.msi`** for Windows
     on ARM (Surface Pro X, Snapdragon X laptops, etc.).
2. Double-click the `.msi`. The installer is per-user (no admin
   prompt), drops the binaries into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\thclaws`,
   adds that directory to your user `PATH`, and creates a Start menu
   entry.
3. Open a fresh PowerShell or terminal window — `thclaws` and
   `thclaws-cli` are on `PATH`. Launch the GUI from Start.

Windows SmartScreen may say "Windows protected your PC" on first run
because the binary isn't signed yet — click **More info → Run
anyway**.

That's it — no `PATH` editing, no environment-variables dialog.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual install (fallback)</strong> — if you'd rather skip the installer (e.g. portable install on a USB stick, automation pipeline, locked-down policy that blocks <code>.msi</code>).</summary>

> **What `%LOCALAPPDATA%` means** — it's a Windows environment variable
> that expands to `C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Local`. So
> `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\thclaws` becomes
> `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Programs\thclaws`. Per-user, no admin
> rights needed (same place GitHub Desktop, VS Code, Cursor install).
> File Explorer's address bar expands it on Enter; in CMD use
> `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...`, in PowerShell use `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\...`.

1. Download `thclaws-<version>-<arch>-pc-windows-msvc.zip`.
2. Extract to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\thclaws` (create the folder if
   it doesn't exist).
3. Add that folder to your user `PATH`:
   - Start → "Edit environment variables for your account"
   - Path → Edit → New → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\thclaws`
   - OK → open a new PowerShell / terminal window.

## Run via Docker

For headless servers, CI runners, or "strict environment" deployments
where installing Rust + Node + GTK/WebKit2GTK on the host isn't an
option, an official image is published on Docker Hub. It bundles the
same `thclaws` binary, runs `--serve` mode by default, and reaches the
host's project folder via a bind mount.

```bash
# Pull the image
$ docker pull thclaws/thclaws:latest

# cd into your project, then:
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -v "$(pwd)":/workspace \
    -p 127.0.0.1:8443:8443 \
    thclaws/thclaws:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8443` in your browser.

> **Adding API keys** — if you've already exported them in your
> shell, they pass through automatically. To inject keys per
> container, add `--env-file .env` to the run line and put
> `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…`, `OPENAI_API_KEY=…`, etc. in a `.env` file
> next to your `pwd`. You can also set keys later from the
> in-browser settings UI; thClaws writes them to
> `.thclaws/settings.json` inside the mount, so they persist across
> container restarts. **Note:** Docker errors out (`open .env: no
> such file or directory`) if you pass `--env-file .env` and the
> file doesn't exist — `touch .env` first or drop the flag. The mounted folder
shows up as `/workspace` inside the container; thClaws writes
session / plan / team / KMS state to `./.thclaws/` on the host, so
everything survives container restarts.

For a long-running setup, a `docker-compose.yml` is shipped in the
repo:

```yaml
services:
  thclaws:
    image: thclaws/thclaws:latest
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:8443:8443"]
    volumes:
      - ./:/workspace
      - thclaws-config:/root/.config/thclaws
    env_file: [.env]
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  thclaws-config:
```

`docker compose up -d` brings it up; `docker compose logs -f thclaws`
tails the live output.

Notes:

- `--serve` has **no application-level auth** in v0.1. Keep the host
  bind on `127.0.0.1` and reach it remotely via SSH tunnel
  (`ssh -L 8443:localhost:8443 server`), or put your own reverse
  proxy + auth in front of it.
- Tags: `:latest` (most recent ship) and `:edge` (current `main`).
  Pin a release tag (e.g. `:0.9.9`) for reproducible deploys.
- The image is multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`); `docker
  pull` picks the right variant for your host.
- API keys come from the `--env-file` / `env_file` block, the host
  shell env passed through Docker, or whatever's already in the
  mounted project's `.thclaws/.env`. The container has no keychain.
- The container runs as root by default so bind-mount writes work
  on Linux without UID juggling. Override with `user: "1000:1000"`
  in compose if that matters to you.

The technical manual's [`docker.md`](../thclaws-technical-manual/docker.md)
covers the image's build chain, why it carries GTK + WebKit2GTK at
runtime, and the publish workflow.

## Optional: Ollama for fully local use

If you want to run entirely against a local model (no cloud API key),
install Ollama alongside thClaws:

```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama

# Linux (script installer)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Windows
# Download the installer from ollama.com/download
```

Start the Ollama daemon (`ollama serve`, or the desktop app) and pull
a model capable enough for agentic work. Small models (Llama 3.2,
Phi-3, etc.) tend to fumble tool-call formatting and multi-step
reasoning; **use Gemma 4 26B or larger**:

```bash
$ ollama pull gemma4:26b         # recommended minimum
$ ollama pull gemma4:31b         # better if your hardware can host it
```

Rough hardware budget:

| Model | RAM / VRAM needed |
|---|---|
| `gemma4:26b` | ~20 GB |
| `gemma4:31b` | ~24 GB |

Apple Silicon with 32 GB unified memory runs 31B comfortably; 16 GB
Macs should stick with 26B. On a dedicated GPU you want that much
VRAM, not system RAM.

Switch thClaws to the model with `/model ollama/gemma4:26b` (or
whichever you pulled). No API key needed. Chapter 6 covers Ollama
options in more detail, including the `oa/*` Anthropic-compatible
prefix that often gives cleaner tool calls on the same local models.

![Ollama](../user-manual-img/ollama/ollama.png)

## Verify the install

```bash
$ thclaws --version                   # the GUI binary
$ thclaws-cli --version               # the CLI-only binary
$ thclaws --cli                       # interactive REPL
$ thclaws -p "say hi in one word"     # headless one-shot (--print also works)
```

All four should print or run without error. If `-p` / `--print` asks
for a key, you haven't configured one yet — see Chapter 6.

## Updating

Re-download the newer archive from
https://thclaws.ai/downloads.html and repeat the install
step for your platform. Your existing config (API keys, sessions,
plugins, etc.) under `~/.config/thclaws/` (or `%APPDATA%\thclaws\` on
Windows) is preserved — only the binaries are replaced.

## Uninstalling

```bash
# macOS / Linux
$ rm ~/.local/bin/thclaws ~/.local/bin/thclaws-cli

# Windows (PowerShell)
PS> Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\thclaws" -Recurse
```

Configuration and saved state live under `~/.config/thclaws/` (or
`%APPDATA%\thclaws\` on Windows). Remove those too for a clean
uninstall:

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/.config/thclaws
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `thclaws: command not found` after install | `~/.local/bin` not on `PATH` — add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell rc |
| macOS "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" | One-time: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/thclaws ~/.local/bin/thclaws-cli` |
| Linux: `error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.3` | Install OpenSSL 3 (`sudo apt install libssl3` / `sudo dnf install openssl`) |
| Windows: `thclaws` not recognised in PowerShell | Folder not on PATH — re-check the PATH env var and open a fresh terminal window |
| GUI window doesn't open | Try `thclaws --cli` first — if that works, the GUI webview is missing system deps (WebKit on Linux / WebView2 on Windows) |

## Next

Chapter 3 covers how thClaws scopes itself to your project directory
and the three run modes (GUI, CLI REPL, one-shot `-p` / `--print`).
Chapter 6 is where you configure providers and API keys.
