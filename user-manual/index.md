# thClaws User Manual

A native-Rust AI agent workspace with CLI and desktop GUI. This manual
covers everything from installation through building and deploying
real projects — coding, automation, knowledge bases, and multi-agent
teams.

> **Part II — Case studies (chapters 22–25)** — applied walkthroughs
> for building real projects with thClaws (static sites, Node.js apps,
> AI agents, deploying to Agentic Press) are in active development and
> will be added to this manual as each is reviewed and ready.

## Conventions used in this manual

- `❯` is the REPL prompt; what follows on that line is what **you** type.
- `$` is a shell prompt outside thClaws.
- `[tool: Bash: …]` / `[tokens: Xin/Yout · Ts]` lines show what thClaws prints back.
- Code fences without a language are terminal output; fences with a language (`rust`, `json`, `bash`) are files you write or commands you run.
- **Bold** inside a command label indicates a required input (e.g. **name**).
- Every chapter is self-contained — skip around freely.
