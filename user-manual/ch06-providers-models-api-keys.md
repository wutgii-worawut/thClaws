# Chapter 6 — Providers, models & API keys

thClaws talks to **twenty-one providers**, auto-detected from the model name.
Switch any time with `/model`, `/provider`, or by clicking the provider/model
chip in the sidebar (Desktop GUI, v0.7.2+).

## Provider overview

| Provider | Model prefix | Auth env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agentic Press | `ap/*` | `AGENTIC_PRESS_LLM_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible gateway; many backends under one key |
| Anthropic | `claude-*` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Extended thinking, prompt caching (system + tools) |
| Anthropic Agent SDK | `agent/*` | — (uses Claude Code's own auth) | Drives the `claude` CLI under your Claude Pro / Max subscription instead of API billing. ⚠ thClaws's tool registry doesn't cross the subprocess boundary — the model only sees Claude Code's built-in toolset. KMS / MCP / Agent Teams tools are unreachable from this provider; switch to `claude-*` for those. |
| OpenAI | `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3*`, `o4-*` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Chat Completions; automatic prompt caching |
| OpenAI Responses | `codex/*` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Responses API — newer agentic-native shape |
| ChatGPT Codex | `chatgpt-codex/*` | — (OAuth via Codex CLI) | Runs Codex models against `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`, **billed against your ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team subscription** instead of a paid OpenAI API key. Auth is auto-imported from the official Codex CLI's `~/.codex/auth.json` (run `codex login` once). Default `chatgpt-codex/gpt-5.4`. Added in v0.9.5 |
| OpenAI-Compatible | `oai/*` | `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY` (+ `OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL`) | Generic OAI-compat endpoint — point at any LiteLLM/Portkey/Helicone/vLLM/internal-proxy that speaks `/v1/chat/completions`; `oai/` prefix stripped before forwarding |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter/*` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Unified gateway to 300+ models across every major LLM vendor |
| Gemini | `gemini-*`, `gemma-*` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemma served via Google AI Studio |
| Ollama | `ollama/*` | — (local) | NDJSON streaming; no auth |
| Ollama Anthropic | `oa/*` | — (local, v0.14+) | Ollama's Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint |
| DashScope | `qwen-*`, `qwq-*` | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | Alibaba Qwen mainland endpoint (`dashscope.aliyuncs.com`); automatic caching |
| QwenCloud | `qc/*` | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` (+ `QWENCLOUD_BASE_URL`) | Alibaba DashScope **Singapore** region (`dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`). Same Qwen catalogue as DashScope but lower latency from outside mainland China. `qc/` prefix stripped on the wire so the upstream sees the bare `qwen-*` id. Added in v0.9.0 |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek-*` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (+ `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`) | V4 line: `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`. Older aliases `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` still work as wire-level aliases |
| ThaiLLM (NSTDA) | `thaillm/*` | `THAILLM_API_KEY` | Aggregator at `thaillm.or.th` for four 8B Thai-tuned models (OpenThaiGPT, Typhoon-S, Pathumma, THaLLE). Aliases (case-insensitive): `openthaigpt`, `typhoon`, `pathumma`, `thalle` |
| Z.ai | `zai/*` | `ZAI_API_KEY` (+ `ZAI_BASE_URL`) | GLM Coding Plan endpoint at `api.z.ai`. Default `zai/glm-4.6`; latest `zai/glm-5.1` (202K context) added in v0.8.5. Override `ZAI_BASE_URL` for the general BigModel SKU at `open.bigmodel.cn` |
| MiniMax | `minimax/*` | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` (+ `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`) | International endpoint at `api.minimax.io`. Models: `minimax/MiniMax-M2` (200K/131K — flagship, default), `minimax/MiniMax-M1` (1M context), `minimax/abab7-chat-preview`. China-platform users on `api.minimax.chat` need to override `MINIMAX_BASE_URL` (different auth scheme — YMMV). Added in v0.8.5 |
| Ollama Cloud | `ollama-cloud/*` | `OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY` | Hosted Ollama catalog (Kimi, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek, Llama, etc.). OpenAI-compatible at `ollama.com/v1` |
| NVIDIA NIM | `nvidia/*` | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` (+ `NVIDIA_BASE_URL`) | NVIDIA hosted inference at `integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`. Catalog spans Nemotron, Llama, DeepSeek, GLM and more — the `nvidia/` prefix routes everything; the outer prefix is stripped on the wire. Override the env var for on-prem NIM deployments |
| LMStudio | `lmstudio/*` | — (local) | LMStudio's local OpenAI-compatible server at `localhost:1234/v1`. No auth. Models follow whatever's loaded in the LMStudio app |
| Azure AI Foundry | `azure/<deployment>` | `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` (+ `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`) | Anthropic-Messages-shaped Azure deployments. `<deployment>` is your Azure-side deployment name (no defaults — set per subscription) |

The default on first run is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; change it with
`--model` on the command line or persist in `settings.json`.

## Switching providers

```
❯ /providers
    agentic-press → ap/gemma4-12b
  * anthropic     → claude-sonnet-4-6
    anthropic-agent → agent/claude-sonnet-4-6
    openrouter    → openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
    ...

❯ /provider openai
provider → openai (model: gpt-4o, saved to .thclaws/settings.json; new session sess-…)

❯ /provider
current provider: openai (model: gpt-4o)
```

Switching always **forks a fresh session** (see [Chapter 7](ch07-sessions.md)) — the old
conversation is saved, a new one starts with the new provider.

## Switching models

`/model` takes the full model id or a short alias:

| Alias | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `sonnet` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `opus`   | `claude-opus-4-6` |
| `haiku`  | `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `flash`  | `gemini-2.0-flash` |

```
❯ /model sonnet
(alias 'sonnet' → 'claude-sonnet-4-6')
model → claude-sonnet-4-6 (saved to .thclaws/settings.json; new session sess-…)

❯ /models
  claude-haiku-4-5
  claude-opus-4-6
  claude-sonnet-4-6
  ...
```

`/model` **validates** the name against `list_models` before committing.
A typo like `/model gemma4-9999` leaves the current model in place and
prints `unknown model '…' — try /models`.

`/models` lists the server's reported catalogue for the current
provider. For Ollama and Agentic Press, IDs come back prefixed (e.g.
`ollama/llama3.2`, `ap/gemma4-26b`) so you can paste them straight
into `/model`.

## Reasoning / "thinking" models

Models in the families below emit a `reasoning_content` field
alongside their normal `content`, and the provider **requires the
prior `reasoning_content` to be sent back** on every subsequent turn —
otherwise the API rejects with HTTP 400 *"The reasoning_content in the
thinking mode must be passed back to the API"*.

thClaws handles this transparently: it captures the reasoning into a
hidden `Thinking` content block on the assistant message, and on the
next request echoes it back **only** for providers that need it.

| Family | Example model id | Provider |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek v4 | `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro` (native) · `deepseek/deepseek-v4-*` (OpenRouter) | DeepSeek, OpenRouter |
| DeepSeek r1 | `deepseek-reasoner` (native) · `deepseek/deepseek-r1`, `deepseek-r1` | DeepSeek, OpenRouter |
| OpenAI o-series | `openai/o1-mini`, `openai/o3`, `openai/o4-*` | OpenRouter |

For everything outside those families (gpt-4o, claude-sonnet-4-6,
qwen3.6-plus, etc.) the `Thinking` block is **dropped** during
serialization — no extra input tokens, no risk of the provider
rejecting an unknown field.

If you switch from a thinking model to a non-thinking model
mid-session, the prior reasoning blocks stay in your session JSONL but
don't go on the wire. No token leak.

## For contributors — `make catalogue`

If you build from source and want to refresh the bundled
`model_catalogue.json` (the compile-time baseline that ships with the
binary), the workspace Makefile has a target:

```sh
make catalogue
```

It pulls the model lists from OpenRouter (always, no key required)
plus Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini if their API keys are set, plus
Ollama if reachable at `localhost:11434`, and merges into the
catalogue **insert-only** (hand-curated rows are never overwritten).
The report shows new IDs added per provider plus counts of unchanged +
skipped (no context_length) entries, then prints `git diff --stat` so
you can review before committing.

## API key hierarchy

Keys are **never stored in `settings.json`**. thClaws looks in four
places, highest priority wins:

| Level | Location | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Shell export | `~/.zshrc`, CI env, etc. | Every process |
| OS keychain | macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service | Every thClaws session on this machine |
| User `.env` | `~/.config/thclaws/.env` | Every thClaws session |
| Project `.env` | `./.env` in the working directory | This project only |

**Recommended**: use the **Settings modal (GUI)** — it saves keys to
the OS keychain, which is materially more secure than any `.env`
path:

| | OS keychain (via Settings modal) | `.env` file |
|---|---|---|
| At-rest encryption | ✓ derived from your login password (Secure Enclave on modern Macs) | ✗ plaintext |
| Access control | ✓ tied to your user account | ✗ any process with filesystem read access |
| Accidental git commit | ✓ impossible (not a file in the repo) | ⚠ easy (people forget `.gitignore`) |
| Leaks via Time Machine / cloud sync / rsync | ✓ no | ⚠ yes — the file goes where your backups go |
| Works headless / in CI | ✗ no Secret Service on most headless Linux | ✓ yes |

So: use the Settings modal on your laptop or workstation; fall back
to `.env` only when you're in an environment that lacks a keychain
(CI runners, minimal Docker images, headless servers).

## Secrets backend chooser {#secrets-backend-chooser}

The **first time you launch thClaws**, right after you pick a working
directory (Chapter 3), a dialog asks you to pick how your secrets
should be stored. This runs before thClaws touches the OS keychain at
all — pick `.env` and no keychain prompt ever fires.

![Where should thClaws store API keys? — OS keychain (recommended) vs .env file](../user-manual-img/ch-03/secrets-backend-chooser.png)

Two choices:

- **OS keychain (recommended)** — macOS Keychain / Windows Credential
  Manager / Linux Secret Service. Encrypted at rest and tied to your
  user account. The first time thClaws reads a key you'll get a
  one-time OS access prompt; click "Always Allow" and it's silent
  after.
- **`.env` file** — plain-text at `~/.config/thclaws/.env`. No
  keychain prompts ever. Works on headless Linux boxes that lack
  Secret Service. Trade-off: anyone with read access to your home
  directory can read the file, so treat it like any other secret.

Your choice is saved to `~/.config/thclaws/secrets.json` and respected
forever after. You can change your mind later: Settings → Provider API
keys → "Change…" link in the modal header re-opens the chooser.

### Single-entry keychain bundle (one prompt per launch)

When you pick the keychain backend, all provider keys live inside **one**
keychain item — service `thclaws`, account `api-keys`, storing a JSON map
`{"anthropic": "sk-ant-…", "openai": "sk-…", …}`. This matters because macOS
Keychain ACLs are per-item: with N separate items you'd get N prompts at every
launch of a rebuilt binary. With one bundle, you see **one** prompt, click
"Always Allow", and subsequent launches of the signed binary are silent.

Migration is automatic — first time thClaws reads the bundle, any legacy
per-provider entries get pulled into the bundle and the bundle is written back.

### Cross-process key visibility

The desktop GUI and the PTY-child REPL are separate OS processes. When you
save a key in Settings, the GUI sets the env var for *itself*, but the already-
running REPL child can't see the GUI process's env changes. To keep both in
sync, every request reads the keychain live if the env var isn't present —
so a key saved in Settings is immediately usable in the Terminal tab's REPL.

### Auto-switch on key save {#auto-switch-on-key-save}

The tricky case: you save an Anthropic key, but `config.model` is still
`gpt-4o` (OpenAI). Without auto-switch you'd still see the red "no API key"
indicator.

thClaws handles this: right after a successful key save, if the currently
configured model's provider has no credentials, the active model rewrites to
the newly-usable provider's default (Anthropic → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, OpenAI →
`gpt-4o`, etc.). The sidebar flips to green within a second, and the next
chat turn just works.

### Diagnostic env vars

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `THCLAWS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN=1` | Skip keychain entirely. Use for tests and to diagnose flakiness. |
| `THCLAWS_KEYCHAIN_TRACE=1` | Print purple diagnostic lines every time a keychain call is made. Shows process ID and the "already loaded" flag. |
| `THCLAWS_KEYCHAIN_LOADED=1` | Set automatically by the GUI after first keychain read so the spawned PTY child skips its own walk. You shouldn't need to touch this. |

## The Settings modal (GUI)

Click the gear icon in the bottom status bar. Each provider card shows:

- **API Key** field — pre-filled with `*****` (asterisks sized to the
  stored key's length, capped at 64). Typing anything replaces the
  sentinel; the field flips from plain text to masked. Save is disabled
  until you type a real new value.
- **Base URL** field (Ollama only) — pre-filled with the current
  configured value or the default placeholder. Stored in
  `~/.config/thclaws/endpoints.json`.

DashScope is locked to its default in the Settings UI but can be
pointed at a regional endpoint with the `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL` env var
if you need it (e.g. the Alibaba Cloud International URL).

Clear a key with the trash icon; the keychain entry is deleted and the
env var unset for the running session.

## `.env` files (CI, headless, quick-start)

When the keychain isn't an option — CI runners, headless Linux boxes
without Secret Service, or when you want a key that CLI-only tools
(scripts, `thclaws -p` in pipelines) can read — the classic `.env`
path still works:

```bash
# ~/.config/thclaws/.env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=AI...
AGENTIC_PRESS_LLM_API_KEY=llm_v1_...
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434   # defaults to this anyway
OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1   # any OAI-compat gateway
OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY=...
```

> ⚠️ **If you use git, add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately** — before
> you paste any key into it. An `.env` committed to a public (or even
> private shared) repo is the single most common way API keys leak.
> The project-scope `./.env` is especially risky because it lives in
> your repo root; the user-scope `~/.config/thclaws/.env` is outside
> any repo so it's safe there, but still treat it as a secret file.
>
> A one-line fix:
>
> ```bash
> $ echo ".env" >> .gitignore && git add .gitignore
> ```
>
> And if you think you already committed one — rotate the key right
> away at the provider's dashboard. Git history preserves deleted
> files forever; rewriting history is messy and anyone who cloned
> before you noticed already has the key.

## Using Ollama locally

1. Install Ollama: `brew install ollama` (macOS) or see ollama.com.
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`.
3. Tell thClaws: `/model ollama/llama3.2`.

No API key. For a remote Ollama server, set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
(Settings modal or env var).

## Using Agentic Press (hosted multi-model)

Agentic Press is a gateway that serves several backends (Gemma 3, GPT
4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, Llama 4, Qwen 3) under one API key. Great for
trying different models without signing up everywhere.

1. Get a key from your Agentic Press dashboard.
2. Paste it into Settings → API Keys (Agentic Press) — or set
   `AGENTIC_PRESS_LLM_API_KEY`.
3. `/model ap/gemma4-26b` (or any listed model).

The `ap/` prefix routes requests through the gateway. `/models` lists
everything the gateway currently serves.

## Using OpenRouter (300+ models via one key)

OpenRouter is a unified gateway to every major LLM vendor (Anthropic,
OpenAI, Google, Meta, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and more). One
API key, 300+ models.

1. Get a key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
2. Paste it into Settings → API Keys (OpenRouter) — or set
   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
3. Pick a model: `/model openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` (or
   any of the hundreds listed by `/models`).

Model IDs follow the `openrouter/<vendor>/<model>` shape — copy them
from [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models) or paste the
exact string you see in `/models` output.

Good for:

- Comparing responses across vendors without signing up everywhere
- Testing a new model without a separate account
- Single billing relationship for hobby / small-team use

Note: OpenRouter adds a small markup on top of each vendor's cost.
For high-volume production use, go direct to the source provider.

### "Free only" toggle (v0.9.4+)

OpenRouter ships a number of zero-cost models (`google/gemma-*:free`,
`meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`, `qwen/qwen3-coder:free`,
etc. — typically rate-limited by the upstream provider but $0 / $0
priced). Settings → API Keys → OpenRouter has a **Free only**
checkbox that filters both the picker AND the `/models` slash command
to rows the catalogue flagged with `free: true`:

```
❯ /models
models — openrouter (29 entries, from catalogue, free only)
  openrouter/google/gemma-4-31b-it:free               262K
  openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free    65K
  openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder:free                    262K
  …
```

The flag persists in `.thclaws/settings.json` as
`openrouterFreeOnly: true`. Toggle off any time to see the full
catalogue again. Other providers ignore this flag — only OpenRouter
publishes per-model pricing the catalogue can read.

When `/models` returns fewer rows than you expect, two filters are
always on regardless of the toggle: (1) rows flagged `chat: false`
(audio / image / video / embedding generation — Lyria, Imagen,
gpt-audio, etc.) never appear in the picker because the agent feeds
the response straight into a chat bubble; (2) the catalogue refresh
older than 24 h may be missing entries — run `/models refresh` to
re-seed.

### Canonical model IDs in /models output

`/models` prints fully-qualified, copy-paste-able ids. OpenRouter
rows show the `openrouter/<vendor>/<model>` prefix even though the
on-disk catalogue stores them bare, because
`ProviderKind::detect("google/gemma-…")` returns `None` without the
prefix and `/model <id>` would error "unknown model provider".
Anything you copy from `/models` straight into `/model <id>` will
route correctly.

## Using a generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`oai/*`)

The `OpenAICompat` provider is a single configurable slot for **any
service that speaks OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` wire format with
a Bearer token**. Common targets:

- LLM gateways: LiteLLM, Portkey, Helicone, internal corporate
  proxies that consolidate vendor billing and apply org-wide policy.
- Self-hosted inference: vLLM, text-generation-inference, lm-deploy,
  llama.cpp's `server` binary in OpenAI-compat mode, MLX-LM, etc.
- Aggregator services other than OpenRouter that follow the same
  shape but live on a private URL.

Two env vars (or the matching Settings modal card):

```sh
OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY=...
```

Then pick a model:

```
/model oai/<upstream-model-id>
```

The `oai/` prefix is **stripped** before the request reaches the
upstream — pass any model id the gateway accepts. Examples:

- `/model oai/gpt-4o-mini` → wire payload `model: "gpt-4o-mini"`
- `/model oai/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` → wire payload
  `model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"`
- `/model oai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` → wire payload
  `model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`

This is intentionally separate from `ProviderKind::OpenAI` so real
OpenAI usage (`OPENAI_API_KEY` + `gpt-*` / `o*` models) is
unaffected. Both can coexist — set both env vars and switch with
`/model gpt-4o` (real OpenAI) vs `/model oai/<id>` (your gateway).

The Base URL accepts either form:

- Ending in `/v1` — `/chat/completions` is appended automatically.
- Ending in `/v1/chat/completions` — used as-is.

Authentication is a standard `Authorization: Bearer
$OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY` header. Gateways with non-Bearer auth (custom
header names, mTLS, etc.) are out of scope — file an issue or use
the EE Phase 3 org-policy `gateway` route.

If your endpoint also implements `/v1/models`, `/models refresh`
will populate the catalogue automatically. If it doesn't, the
refresh fails silently and chat continues to work.

## Using ChatGPT-subscription Codex (`chatgpt-codex/*`)

Runs Codex models against `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`,
**billed against a ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team subscription** instead
of a paid OpenAI API key. Same wire path the official Codex CLI
uses.

Setup is one-time, and thClaws piggy-backs on the official Codex
CLI's auth:

1. Install the Codex CLI (`npm i -g @openai/codex-cli` or follow
   their docs).
2. Run `codex login` once — opens a browser, you sign in to your
   ChatGPT account, the CLI persists tokens at
   `~/.codex/auth.json`.
3. In thClaws: `/model chatgpt-codex/gpt-5.4` (or any other Codex
   model under your subscription's tier).

thClaws auto-imports the auth file on first use — no separate
thClaws-side login. When the access token expires, re-run `codex
login`; thClaws picks up the refreshed file on the next call.

Caveats:

- The endpoint is undocumented. OpenAI can change the wire shape
  without notice. If you hit a 400 with an unexpected field name,
  check the [thclaws issues](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues)
  before debugging.
- Subscription rate limits apply (typically much more generous than
  free API tiers but still finite — heavy automation may hit them).
- Token refresh is not yet automated inside thClaws (re-run `codex
  login` when you see auth errors).

Added in v0.9.5 via PR #88. Credits: ported from themion's
`client_codex.rs`.

## Sign in to thClaws Cloud (Google) — optional

The top-right of the navbar has a **Sign in** button. Signing in
with Google authenticates you against `cloud.thclaws.ai` and
unlocks future cloud-side features (paid credit, the cloud gateway
proxy planned in plan-09 — not yet live as of v0.9.5).

**Important:** thClaws is fully usable without signing in. The
button is opt-in; nothing breaks if you ignore it.

The standard (non-enterprise) flow uses your own Google OAuth
project — drop `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` into
`.env` (or the workspace's environment) before launching:

```sh
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...
```

Then click **Sign in → Sign in with Google**. Browser opens →
Google consent → desktop catches the callback → button switches to
your email + a checkmark. Tokens land in your OS keychain (macOS
Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service),
**not in `.env`** — even when you've otherwise chosen the dotenv
backend for API-key storage.

Official thClaws builds (the dmg / msi distributed by the project)
ship with bundled OAuth credentials so the button works out of the
box. If you build from source, set the env vars as above.

Enterprises that ship a signed policy file with `policies.sso`
override the standard Google flow — the navbar shows their IdP
instead. See the technical manual's SSO doc for the gateway-side
verification model.
