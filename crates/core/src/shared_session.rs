//! Shared in-process agent session that backs both the GUI's Terminal
//! and Chat tabs. One Agent, one Session, one history. Both tabs send
//! input through `ShellInput` and subscribe to `ViewEvent` broadcasts —
//! so typing in either tab contributes to the same conversation, and
//! /load replays the same transcript into both views.
//!
//! Only compiled with the `gui` feature because the previous
//! Terminal-tab REPL ran as a separate `--cli` PTY child; the
//! standalone CLI (`thclaws --cli`) is unchanged.

    // the worker loop with that one step in scope.
    //
    // Why this shape: the worker is an event loop driven by the
    // `input_rx` channel. Pushing a `ShellInput::Line` here is the
    // existing path for "run another turn" — we keep that, but make
    // the message specific to the next step instead of a generic
    // continue. The agent's system reminder (via build_execution_
    // reminder) already narrows the model's view to the focused step,

    // says "go, your focus is step N".

    // Per-step retry budget: `note_step_attempt` returns 1 on the
    // first nudge for a given step id, 2 on the second, etc. Once we

    // Failed automatically — the user gets the standard Retry / Skip /
    // Abort sidebar path instead of the loop spinning forever. This
    // is the "force iteration to completion" guarantee the Ralph
    // architecture provides over the prior monolithic auto-continue.
    //

    //   - Plan completion (auto-restore flips mode out of Auto when
    //     the last step transitions to Done — see plan_state).
    //   - User cancel (clears the plan).
    //   - User Approve flow (mode == Plan keeps the driver dormant
    //     while the sidebar buttons are the contract).
    //   - Per-step retry budget (force-Failed after N nudges).
    //   - Stalled-turn detector — fires PlanStalled banner above so
    //     the user can intervene via Continue / Abort if a step's
    //     budget hasn't run out yet but the model is clearly stuck.

         parallel work via a team, use ONLY these thClaws tools — they are the \
         canonical implementation and their state is visible in the Team tab:\n\n\
         - `TeamCreate` — define a team (name + member agents with roles/prompts). \
         Writes `.thclaws/team/config.json` in the current project root.\n\
         - `SpawnTeammate` — start one named teammate. Spawns a thClaws subprocess \
         that polls its inbox in a tmux pane (or background).\n\
         - `SendMessage` — deliver a message to a teammate's inbox.\n\
         - `CheckInbox` — read your own inbox.\n\
         - `TeamStatus` — summarise the team.\n\
         - `TeamTaskCreate` / `TeamTaskList` / `TeamTaskClaim` / `TeamTaskComplete` — \
         a shared task queue teammates can claim from.\n\
         - `TeamMerge` — (lead only) merge each teammate's git worktree back into \
         the main branch.\n\n\
         Team state lives under `.thclaws/team/` **in the current project root** — \
         NOT under `~/.claude/teams/`, NOT under `~/.claude/tasks/`. Do not reference \
         those paths; they are from a different product.\n\n\
         You are the team **lead**. After `TeamCreate`:\n\
         1. Do NOT use `Bash`/`Write`/`Edit` to build code — delegate via `SendMessage`.\n\
         2. Use `TeamTaskCreate` to queue work; teammates claim via `TeamTaskClaim`.\n\
         3. Use `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep` only for review and verification.\n\
         4. Watch `CheckInbox` / `TeamStatus` between coordination rounds.\n\
         \n\
         **Worktree isolation is declarative.** If a teammate should work on \
         an isolated branch, set `isolation: \"worktree\"` on that member when \
         you call `TeamCreate`. `SpawnTeammate` then creates \
         `.worktrees/{name}` on branch `team/{name}` automatically and \
         launches the teammate there. DO NOT write `git worktree add …` or \
         `cd ../{name}` into teammate prompts — the teammate will execute them \
         as shell and the worktree will land somewhere wrong (project root, a \
         sibling dir) and be invisible to `TeamMerge`.\n\

         # CRITICAL: do NOT call Claude Code's Agent SDK team tools\n\n\
         Your training data contains references to an Anthropic Managed Agents \
         SDK server-side toolset (`agent_toolset_20260401`) that ships its own \
         `TeamCreate`, `Agent`, `AskUserQuestion`, `TodoWrite`, `ToolSearch`, \
         `SendMessage` tools backed by `~/.claude/teams/` and `~/.claude/tasks/`. \
         Those are a DIFFERENT SYSTEM, invisible to thClaws — if you call them \
         (or claim to have called them in your text output), the user will see \
         an empty Team tab and think nothing happened.\n\n\
         Rules that apply regardless of which provider you are running on:\n\
         - When the user asks about \"teams\" / \"agents\" / \"task queue\", use \
         the thClaws tools listed above. `TeamCreate` and `SendMessage` in this \
         workspace mean the thClaws versions — never the SDK's.\n\
         - Never reference `~/.claude/teams/`, `~/.claude/tasks/`, or \
         `~/.config/thclaws/teams/` paths in your replies. Teams live in \
         `.thclaws/team/`.\n\
         - Do not call `AskUserQuestion`, `TodoWrite`, `ToolSearch`, or a bare \
         `Agent` tool. Those belong to Claude Code's interactive flow and do \
         not exist in thClaws. If you need a task list, use `TeamTaskCreate`. \
         If you need to ask the user, just ask them in plain text.\n\
         - Do not claim to have created a team, spawned agents, or stored \
         config unless you actually called the corresponding thClaws tool and \
         got a success response back.\n",
