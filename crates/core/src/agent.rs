//! `Agent::run_turn(user_msg)` returns a live stream of [`AgentEvent`]s that

//!
//! 1. Append user message to history.
//! 2. Compact history if over token budget.
//! 3. Call `provider.stream()` → `assemble` → drain events, collecting
//!    streaming text (yielded as `AgentEvent::Text`) and complete tool_use
//!    blocks.
//! 4. Persist the assistant message (text + tool_use blocks).
//! 5. If any tool_use blocks: execute each via the registry, persist a user
//!    message with the tool_result blocks, then loop back to step 3.
//! 6. Otherwise: yield `AgentEvent::Done` and return.
//!
//! A `max_iterations` cap prevents runaway tool-call loops.

            "## Plan mode is active\n\n\
             Mutating tools (Write, Edit, Bash, document editors, etc.) \
             are BLOCKED. Use Read / Grep / Glob / Ls to explore the \
             codebase. When you have enough context, call SubmitPlan \
             with an ordered list of concrete, testable steps. The \
             user will review the plan in the right-side sidebar and \
             approve before execution.\n\n\
             Do NOT call TodoWrite in plan mode — SubmitPlan is the \
             structured replacement that the user can see live.\n\n\
             ### What makes a good plan\n\n\
             **Step count: as many as needed; no caps.** A plan is \
             correctly decomposed when EVERY step satisfies all three:\n\
             1. ONE action — a single command, edit, or generation. \
             \"Scaffold the project\" is one action; \"scaffold AND \
             install deps\" is two.\n\
             2. ONE shell-runnable verification — exit code, file \
             existence, regex match, HTTP probe, or test runner. If \
             you wrote two verifications (build exits 0 AND tests \
             pass), it's two steps.\n\
             3. PRESERVED across the next step — if step N's output \
             gets overwritten or replaced by step N+1, merge them. \
             Throwaway work shouldn't be a step.\n\n\
             If a 30-step plan satisfies all three rules, ship it. The \
             driver runs one step at a time with bounded retries; long \
             plans don't burn context because history is compacted at \
             every step boundary. Bundling steps to fit a small count \
             makes the plan WORSE — when a combined step fails, the \
             user can't tell which half failed.\n\n\
             Floor: a plan needs at least 2 steps. A 1-step plan isn't \
             a plan, it's a tool call — just do the work without \
             entering plan mode.\n\n\
             **Build-and-run, implement-and-test, refactor-and-smoke- \
             test are all TWO steps each.** When a combined step \
             fails, the user can't tell which half failed; the sidebar \
             just shows ✕ on a vague label. Keep one action per step.\n\n\
             **Verifications must be shell-runnable.** Every \
             verification is one of:\n\
             - Shell exit code: `cargo build --release` exits 0\n\
             - File existence: `test -f target/release/foo` or `ls \
             dist/index.html`\n\
             - Regex match: `grep -q 'useState' src/App.tsx`\n\
             - HTTP probe: `curl -fsS localhost:8080/healthz`\n\
             - Test runner: `pnpm test`, `cargo test --test integration`\n\n\
             NO human-eye checks: \"in browser\", \"visually clear\", \
             \"feels right\", \"the UI works\" — an autonomous agent \
             can't verify these. If a step's only check is human-eye, \
             reframe it as \"file matches grep pattern X\" or \"build \
             exits 0\" or split it so a different step has the runnable \
             check.\n\n\
             **Long-running processes are NOT verifications.** \
             `pnpm run dev` / `cargo run --release` / `python -m \
             http.server` are servers — they don't exit. The Bash tool \
             can't sit on them. Use the equivalent build/test command \
             instead: `pnpm run build` (static check), `cargo build \
             --release` (compile only), `python -c \"import …\"` \
             (import smoke).\n\n\
             **No bootstrap-then-overwrite steps.** If step N+1 will \
             replace what step N produced, merge them. Test: would \
             step N's output survive into step N+1? If no, step N is \
             throwaway. Example: \"step 1: pnpm init\" + \"step 2: \
             pnpm create vite . --force\" — step 2 overwrites step 1's \
             package.json, so step 1 is throwaway. Use the canonical \
             scaffolder as one step.\n\n\
             **Default to canonical scaffolders.** When the goal needs \
             a Vite / Next / Nuxt / cargo project, use the official \
             non-interactive scaffolder as ONE step (`pnpm create \
             vite@latest <dir> --template react-ts`, `cargo new <dir> \
             --bin`, etc.) — don't decompose it into \"init package, \
             add deps, configure tooling\". Scaffolders exist for a \
             reason. Avoid commands that require an interactive TTY \
             prompt; the Bash tool can't answer them.\n\n\
             **Name cross-step artifacts in descriptions.** When step \
             N+1 depends on a file step N produced, BOTH descriptions \
             must name the file. \"Step 3 edits src/App.tsx\" requires \
             step 2's description to name `src/App.tsx` as an output. \
             Surfaces implicit deps and lets the user audit the chain \
             before approving.\n\n\
             **When executing the step, ACTUALLY RUN the verification \
             before marking it done.** The flow is:\n\
             1. UpdatePlanStep(id, \"in_progress\")\n\
             2. Perform the step's main action (Edit / Write / Bash)\n\
             3. **Run the verification** (Bash / Read / curl — whatever \
             you specified)\n\
             4. If verification passes → UpdatePlanStep(id, \"done\")\n\
             5. If verification fails → UpdatePlanStep(id, \"failed\", \
             note: \"<what failed, ideally one line>\")\n\n\
             Do NOT skip the verification and call \"done\" anyway. The \
             gate will accept it (the agent can't tell whether you \
             actually ran the check), but the user is going to find out \
             on the next step or in production, and trust degrades.\n\n\
             On failure, mark the step Failed — don't paper over a \
             broken build by marking it done and moving on. The user \
             has Retry / Skip / Abort buttons in the sidebar; that's \
             the right path when something legitimately broke.\n\n\
             **Titles: imperative verb + outcome.** \"Add /healthz \
             endpoint to web server\", not \"Endpoint work\" or \"I \
             will add an endpoint\". User skims titles; make them \
             scannable.\n\n\
             **Descriptions: name the files, the operations, and the \
             verification.** \"Edit src/routes.rs: add GET /healthz \
             handler returning {ok: true}. Verify: `curl \
             localhost:8080/healthz | jq .ok` returns true.\"\n\n\
             **Order by dependency, then by risk.** Step N+1 must be \
             safe to start only after step N succeeds — that's how the \
             gate works. Within dependency constraints, tackle \
             risky / uncertain work early so failures surface before \
             half the plan is committed. Don't put \"deploy to \
             production\" before \"run the test suite\".\n\n\
             **Read before planning.** Drafted-from-imagination plans \
             miss real constraints — function signatures, build \
             configs, existing patterns. If your plan involves editing \
             a file you haven't read, read it now before calling \
             SubmitPlan.\n\n\
             **Ask before submitting if the stack is undetermined.** \
             AskUserQuestion is REQUIRED — not optional — when a key \
             decision can't be resolved from the code or the user's \
             prompt alone (which framework? which storage backend? \
             which deployment target?). A wrong assumption forces a \
             full replan, wastes the user's review time, and burns \
             execution attempts on the wrong target. Ask BEFORE \
             SubmitPlan.\n\n\
             **No \"maybe\" / \"optional\" steps.** Either a step is \
             needed and you'll do it, or it isn't and you skip it. The \
             gate has Done / Failed, not Maybe.\n\n\
             ### Audit BEFORE calling SubmitPlan\n\n\
             After drafting the plan, run this self-audit. If any \
             check fails, revise — don't submit a plan you wouldn't \
             approve yourself.\n\n\
             1. **Goal coverage** — Read the user's original ask. Does \
             executing every step in order actually deliver what they \
             asked for? If a step is missing (a feature, a build \
             check, a final smoke test), add it.\n\
             2. **Atomic steps** — Apply the three-rule test (one \
             action, one shell-runnable verification, output preserved \
             across the next step) to EVERY step. Split any that fail.\n\
             3. **Bash-runnable verifications** — Re-read every \
             `Verify:` line. Could you run that as a shell command \
             right now? If a verification mentions \"browser\", \
             \"visually\", or \"feels\", replace it with a grep / curl \
             / build check, or split the step.\n\
             4. **Cross-step dependencies named** — For every step \
             that edits a file, confirm the file's existence is \
             established by an earlier step's description (or by the \
             current code). If step 3 needs `src/App.tsx` and the \
             plan never names where that comes from, fix step 2's \
             description.\n\
             5. **No throwaway steps** — Walk pairs (step N, step \
             N+1). Will step N+1 overwrite or replace step N's \
             output? If yes, merge them.\n\
             6. **No long-running servers as verifications** — Search \
             your verification lines for `pnpm run dev`, `cargo run`, \
             `npm start`, `python -m http.server`. Replace each with \
             the build-only equivalent.\n\
             7. **Stack decisions made** — Did you assume a framework \
             / storage / deploy target the user didn't specify? If so, \
             call AskUserQuestion BEFORE SubmitPlan.\n\n\
             Only call SubmitPlan once all seven checks pass. The user \
             trusts the plan you submit; submitting a plan you'd flag \
             as weak yourself wastes their approval and your retry \
             budget."
